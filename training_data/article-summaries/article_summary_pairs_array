Over the past quarter\nof a century, clinical medicine has become more sophisticated, technological\nadvances have become more commonplace, and the range of health care interven-\ntions has been much expanded. Yet over the same period, the numbers of persons\nwithout health insurance to help them purchase health services has increased by\nabout one million per year\u2014faster than the rate of overall population growth. The\ntotal number of uninsured Americans grew even during years of economic pros-\nperity (Holahan and Kim, 2000).\nThis report and the five reports that will follow endeavor to present a wide-\nangle view of health insurance and examine the consequences of being without\ninsurance, not only for persons who are uninsured and their families, but also for\nthe communities in which they live and for society. Health insurance is one of the\nbest-known and most common means used to obtain access to health care. What\nare the consequences for all of us of having tens of millions of people uninsured?\nOver the next two years, the Institute of Medicine Committee on the Con-\nsequences of Uninsurance will evaluate and report what is known about the\nimpacts of being uninsured and how being uninsured affects individuals, families,\ncommunities, and society. The Committee will focus on uninsured people, de-\nfined as persons with no health insurance and no assistance in paying for health\ncare beyond what is available through charity and safety-net institutions. It recog-\nnizes, however, that many people have insurance that offers incomplete coverage\nand that being underinsured poses problems as well, though these are generally less\nsevere.

Research and\ninformation about these impacts are extensive but widely scattered. By constitut-\ning and charging this Committee, the Institute of Medicine recognizes both the\nurgency of the issues surrounding health insurance coverage of the U.S. popula-\ntion and the need for consolidating and critically appraising evidence regarding the\nimpacts of uninsurance for individuals and communities. In presenting its evalua-\ntion of the research literature and findings about the health and economic conse-\nquences of uninsurance, the Committee hopes to add context and depth to the\nongoing public dialogue about these issues, by focusing on the connections be-\ntween the lack of coverage and a variety of documented personal and social\noutcomes.\nIn this first report, the Committee provides an overview of health insurance\nin America, looking specifically at how coverage is gained and lost, why so many\npeople have none, and who lacks insurance, as individuals and as members of\ngroups within the general population. In addition, this report introduces the\nCommittee\u2019s analytic plan for  the entire series of reports and presents the concep-\ntual framework that will guide the Committee\u2019s evaluations of specific impacts of\nuninsurance in its subsequent reports.\nMYTHS AND REALITIES\nThis report begins by examining pervasive popular ideas about\nthe scope and nature of the problem of uninsurance that frustrate attempts to\naddress this complex issue constructively. Americans persistently underestimate\nthe numbers of uninsured people and hold many misperceptions about their\nidentity, about how one becomes uninsured, and about the economic and health\nconsequences of being uninsured (Fronstin, 1998; Blendon et al., 1999; News-\nHour\u2013Kaiser, 2000; Wirthlin Worldwide, 2001).\nMyth: People without health insurance get the medical care they need.\nReality:  The uninsured are much more likely than persons with\ninsurance coverage to go without needed care (Schoen and DesRoches,\n2000). They also receive fewer preventive services and less regular care for chronic\nconditions than people with insurance (Ayanian et al., 2000; Baker et al., 2000).\nMyth:  The number of uninsured Americans is not particularly large and has\nnot been increasing in recent years.\nReality:  The number of uninsured people is greater than the com-\nbined populations of Texas, Florida, and Connecticut. During 1999, the\nCensus Bureau estimated that approximately 42 million people in the\nUnited States lacked health insurance coverage (Mills, 2000). This num-\nber represents about 15 percent of a total population of 274 million", "summary": "The Institute of Medicine has formed a Committee to study health insurance coverage in the U.S. The Committee hopes to add context and depth to the public dialogue about these issues. Americans persistently underestimate the number of uninsured people and hold many misperceptions about their identities."}, {"article": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 3\npersons and 17 percent of the population under 65 years of age. 1 An\nestimated ten million of the uninsured are children under the age of 18 (about 14\npercent of all children), and about 32 million are adults between ages 18 and 65\n(about 19 percent of all adults in this group) (Mills, 2000). The estimate of\nuninsured people is even larger when coverage is measured over several years.\nAlmost three out of every ten Americans, more than 70 million people,\nlacked health insurance for at least a month over a 36-month period\n(Bennefield, 1998a).\nEstimates of the number of persons who lack insurance vary depending on the\nsurvey and range from 32 million to 42 million for those without coverage\nthroughout the year.\n2  Surveys differ in their size and sampling methods, the ways\nin which questions are asked about insurance coverage, and the period over which\ninsurance coverage or uninsurance is measured (Lewis et al., 1998; Fronstin,\n2000a). The Current Population Survey (CPS), conducted annually by the Census\nBureau, is the most widely cited source of estimates of the number of uninsured\npersons and is used throughout this report as the primary data source. The CPS is\nparticularly useful because it produces yearly estimates in a timely fashion, report-\ning the previous year\u2019s insurance coverage rates each September, and because\ninformation about insurance coverage has been gathered since the mid-1970s,\nallowing for analysis of coverage trends over time (Figure ES.1). Although the\nCPS nominally reports persons uninsured throughout the entire calendar year,\nsome analysts believe that its estimates actually reflect shorter periods of unin-\nsurance, and thus that its estimates of the number uninsured throughout the year\nare too high (Swartz, 1986).\nWhether one uses the estimate of 42 million uninsured, as reported by the\nCPS, or the lower estimates generated on the basis of other governmentally and\nprivately sponsored surveys, the number of uninsured Americans is substantial. In\nlight of the CPS\u2019s usefulness and its limitations, this report relies on estimates based\non CPS data, with caveats. The Committee finds the variation in estimates among\nsurveys less critical than the order of magnitude of the entire range of estimates\nthat different surveys yield.\nMyth: Most people who lack health insurance are in families where no one\nworks.\nReality: More than 80 percent of uninsured children and adults un-\nder the age of 65 live in working families.  Although working does improve\nthe chances that one and one\u2019s family will have insurance, even members of\n1Because the federal Medicare program provides nearly universal coverage for persons at least 65\nyears of age, the Committee\u2019s work will focus on  uninsured persons under age 65.\n2For 1996, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), conducted by the Agency for\nHealthcare Research and Quality, generated an estimate of 32 million nonelderly persons uninsured", "summary": "Estimates of the number of persons who lack insurance vary depending on the survey. The Current Population Survey (CPS) is the most widely cited source of estimates. The Committee finds the variation in estimates among surveys less critical than the order of magnitude of the entire range of estimates that different surveys yield."}, {"article": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 5\nfamilies with two full-time wage earners have almost a one-in-ten chance of being\nuninsured (Hoffman and Pohl, 2000).\nMyth: Growth in the numbers of recent immigrants has been a major source\nof the increase in the number of uninsured persons.\nReality: Although immigrants who have arrived within 4 years have\nhigher-than-average uninsurance rates, they comprise a relatively small\nproportion of the general population. In fact, between 1994 and 1998, there\nhas been a net decrease in the number of recently arrived immigrants (Holahan et\nal., 2001). Overall, noncitizens account for fewer than one in five uninsured\npersons (Mills, 2000).\nThrough its work, the Committee hopes to replace misperceptions with facts\nand in doing so, to lay the groundwork for a more informed public debate about\nhealth insurance coverage.\nRELATING HEALTH INSURANCE TO ACCESS TO\nHEALTH SERVICES\nHealth insurance serves multiple constituencies and distinct pur-\nposes. For individuals and families, insurance coverage is one means to promote\nhealth and access to care and to protect against exceptional health care costs.\nInsurance pools the risks and resources of a group of people so that each is\nprotected from financially disruptive medical expenses and each may plan ahead or\nbudget for health care. In contrast with many other insurance products, such as\nautomobile or homeowner\u2019s insurance, health insurance has evolved as a mecha-\nnism for financing routine health care expenses and encouraging the use of pre-\nventive services, in addition to protecting against uncommon events and expenses.\nAs the scope and effectiveness of health care interventions have grown, so have\nconsumers\u2019 expectations for coverage and benefits through health insurance.\nOther constituencies also have a stake in our mechanisms for financing health\ncare. Providers of health care benefit from insurance as a reliable source of pay-\nment. Employers offer health benefits to attract and retain workers and to maintain\na productive workforce. Governments provide health insurance to special popula-\ntions as a means to secure health care for them.\nHealth insurance is neither necessary nor sufficient to obtain health care, yet\ncoverage remains one of the most important ways to obtain access to health\nservices. The level of out-of-pocket costs for care has been demonstrated to have\nsubstantial effects on the use of health services (Newhouse et al., 1993; Zweifel\nand Manning, 2000). Uninsured persons may be charged more than patients with\ncoverage, who benefit from discounts negotiated by their insurer (Wielawski,\n2000; Kolata, 2001). In addition, uninsured people face 100 percent cost sharing,\nalthough some providers are willing to absorb part of the cost for some of their\npatients some of the time by negotiating a reduced rate. Even though many\npublicly supported institutions offer free care or reduced fees and many other\nproviders offer some charity care, people without insurance generally have re-", "summary": "Growth in the numbers of recent immigrants has been a major source of the increase in the number of uninsured persons.

Children without insurance are three times as likely as children\nwith Medicaid coverage to have no regular source of care (15 percent of unin-\nsured children do not have a regular provider compared with just 5 percent of\nchildren with Medicaid), and uninsured adults are more than three times as likely\nas either privately or publicly insured adults to lack a regular source of care (35\npercent compared with 11 percent) (Haley and Zuckerman, 2000). The likeli-\nhood that those without health insurance lack a regular source of care has in-\ncreased substantially since 1977 (Zuvekas and Weinick, 1999; Weinick et al.,\n2000).\nUninsured adults are less likely to receive health services, even for certain\nserious conditions. One nationally representative survey that took into account\nage, sex, income, and health status found that uninsured people were less than half\nas likely as those with insurance to receive needed care, as judged by physicians,\nfor a serious medical condition (Baker et al., 2000). People without insurance are\nalso less likely to receive preventive services and appropriate routine care for\nchronic conditions than those with insurance, even as the importance of preven-\ntive care and the prevalence of chronic disease become more prominent elements\nwithin health care (Hafner-Eaton, 1993; Burstin et al., 1998; Ayanian et al., 2000;\nSchoen and DesRoches, 2000; Institute of Medicine, 2001).\nTo guide its assessment of the relationship between the lack of health insur-\nance, access to care, and the consequences of no coverage, the Committee has\nbased its conceptual framework on a widely used behavioral model of access to\nhealth services (Figure ES.2) (Andersen, 1995; Andersen and Davidson, 2001). In\nthis framework the major determinants of insurance coverage are heavily, but not\nexclusively, economic.  The model links these determinants to features of the\nprocess of obtaining health services and to morbidity, mortality, and health status.\nInsurance coverage is thus linked in this model to an array of outcomes through\nthe mediating effect of health care services. The model allows us to track the\neffects from lack of coverage on individuals and families, in a sizable uninsured\npopulation, to the viability of health care providers and institutions at a commu-\nnity level and the implications for the nation\u2019s economy.\nHOW COVERAGE IS GAINED AND LOST\nIn the United States, health insurance is a voluntary matter, yet", "summary": "Uninsured adults are less likely to receive health services, even for certain serious conditions.

The historical tension rooted in American\nsocial values, between considering health care as a market commodity and as a\nsocial good, has fostered the development of variegated and complex arrange-\nments for financing the delivery of health care (Stevens, 1989; Stone, 1993).\nWithin the private sector, insurance coverage depends on an employer\u2019s\ndecision to offer a health benefit plan and an employee\u2019s decision to enroll or take\nup this offer (Figure ES.3). When workers are not offered the chance to purchase\nemployment-based insurance for themselves and their dependent family members\n(spouses and minor children), or when they decline to enroll, individual policies\nand public insurance (Medicaid or the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program\n[SCHIP]) offer limited opportunities for coverage. Poor health status or low\nincome may preclude the purchase of an affordable (or any) individual policy from\nan insurance company. The combination of strict eligibility requirements and\ncomplex enrollment procedures often makes public coverage difficult to obtain\nand even more difficult to maintain over time.\nOpportunities to Purchase Coverage\nAlmost seven out of every ten Americans under age 65 years (66 percent) are\ncovered by employment-based health insurance, from either their job or that of\ntheir parent or spouse (Fronstin, 2000d). Among workers 76 percent are offered\nhealth insurance by their employers, and 83 percent of those offered insurance\ndecide to purchase or take up the offer of coverage (Fronstin, 2001). The 17\npercent of workers that decline an employer\u2019s offer include about 13 percent who\nare covered through a spouse or elsewhere and 4 percent who remain uninsured.\nThe expense and competing demands on family income are the main reasons\ngiven for declining the offer of employment-based insurance (Cooper and Schone,\n1997;  Rowland et al., 1998;  Hoffman and Schlobohm, 2000).\nIndividually purchased policies and public insurance (primarily Medicaid)\nboth fill some of the coverage gaps created by the employment-based system.\nTogether they account for 21 percent of coverage.\n3  Self-employed people (about\n10 percent of workers) and their families must often rely on individually purchased\nhealth insurance. Individual coverage also serves as a stop-gap measure, however,\nfor adult children who lose their coverage as dependents before they can obtain\njob-based coverage and for retirees under the age of 65 before they become\neligible for Medicare.

Conversely, many of these transitional events can result in becoming\neligible for coverage. Because so many different common events are associated\nwith a change in health insurance status, the chance of being uninsured over the\ncourse of a lifetime may be substantial. For example, a young adult (18\u201324) has a\ngreater-than-even chance of being uninsured for at least one month over a 36-\nmonth period (Bennefield, 1998a).\nFor some people, lack of insurance is a temporary or one-time interruption of\ncoverage, while for others, being uninsured is an experience that recurs periodi-\ncally or may last for several years. Lower income persons tend to remain uninsured\nfor longer than do those with incomes above the federal poverty level (McBride,\n1997). Educational attainment and employment sector are factors that also are\nrelated to the length of uninsured periods (Swartz et al., 1993a). Short periods\nwithout health insurance are less likely than longer periods to adversely affect\naccess to health services (Ayanian et al., 2000). Yet even short periods without\ninsurance carry with them the financial risk of extraordinarily high health ex-\npenses.\nLimited Coverage Options\nInsurance industry underwriting practices, the costs of health services, and the\npatchwork of public policies regarding insurance coverage all contribute to the\neconomic pressures on employers, insurers, and government programs offering\nhealth insurance. Small employers frequently face higher group health insurance\npremium rates than large employers do. Larger firms can cushion themselves from\nthe financial impact of insurance company medical underwriting and restrictions\nby choosing to self-insure their employees\u2019 health benefits. Small employers may\nreceive poorer benefits for premiums comparable to those of large firms, because\nof both a higher risk premium and higher administrative costs per person, and\ninadequate resources to evaluate and negotiate good coverage. As a result, some\nsmall employers may decline to offer coverage altogether. Among a group of 955\nsmall businesses (fewer than 50 employees) surveyed, the most common and the\nhighest-ranking reason for not offering insurance benefits was the expense of\ncoverage (Fronstin and Helman, 2000).\nThe expense and competing demands on family income are the main reasons\ngiven by individuals for declining an offer of employment-based coverage. Wage-\nearners who accept or take up an employer\u2019s offer of a subsidized health benefit\ntypically pay between one-quarter and one-third of the total cost of their insur-\nance premium, in addition to deductibles, copayments, and the costs of health", "summary": "Many normal social and economic transitions can trigger a loss of health insurance coverage for a person or family.

These cost increases result\nin part from advances in medical and pharmaceutical technology, an aging popu-\nlation, and reduced consumer sensitivity to prices through expanded insurance\ncoverage (Heffler et al., 2001). Despite the economic prosperity of recent years,\nbetween 1998 and 1999 there was only a slight drop in the number and propor-\ntion of uninsured Americans. Through the early 1990s the rising uninsurance rate\nreflected a decline in employment-based coverage. Since the mid-1990s increases\nin employment-based coverage have been offset by steady or declining rates of\npublic and individually purchased coverage (Fronstin, 2000d).\nA PORTRAIT OF THE UNINSURED\nPeople lack coverage regardless of education, age, or state of\nresidence. Employment and geographic factors are central because private insur-\nance is closely tied to employment, and eligibility for public programs is partly\ndetermined by work and income criteria.\nSocial and Economic Factors Affect Coverage\nFull-time, full-year employment offers families the best chance of having\nhealth insurance, as does an annual income of at least a moderate level (greater\nthan 200 percent of FPL) (Custer and Ketsche, 2000b). Wage earners in smaller\nfirms, lower-waged firms, nonunionized firms, and nonmanufacturing employ-\nment sectors are more likely than average to go without coverage. Members of\nfamilies without wage earners are more likely to be uninsured than are members of\nfamilies with wage earners. Two-thirds of all uninsured persons are members of\nlower-income families (earning less than 200 percent of FPL), and nearly one-\nthird of all members of lower-income families are uninsured.

People 65 and older\nhave a minimal likelihood of being uninsured because Medicare provides virtually\nuniversal coverage to that age group. Marriage and the rearing of infants and\nyoung children both decrease the chances, on average, that an adult will be\nuninsured. Sources of coverage and health status, as well as participation in the\nwork force, also affect one\u2019s chances of lacking coverage.\nDemographic Disparities in Coverage\nHigher uninsured rates among members of racial and ethnic minority groups\nand among recent immigrants reflect their lower rates of employment-based cov-\nerage and lower family incomes, on average, compared to non-Hispanic whites\nand U.S.-born residents. African Americans are twice as likely as non-Hispanic\nwhites to be uninsured, and Hispanics are three times as likely to be uninsured,\nalthough more than half of all uninsured persons are non-Hispanic whites. For-\neign-born residents are almost three times as likely to be uninsured as are those\nborn in the United States, and among the foreign born, noncitizens are more than\ntwice as likely as citizens to be uninsured (Mills, 2000).\nIn addition, there are gender disparities in coverage, reflecting the different\nexperiences of adult men and women in the workplace and with public policies.\nAlthough men are more likely than women to be uninsured, women have a lower\nrate of employment-based coverage. Because women are more likely to obtain\ncoverage through individual policies and public programs, their insurance status\ntends to be less stable, with more opportunities for gaps in coverage (Miles and\nParker, 1997; Fronstin, 2000b).\nGeographic Differences Affect Coverage\nThe decentralized labor and health services markets of the United States and\nthe distinctive public policies of each state and locality together create unique\ncontexts for the patterns of insurance coverage for individuals, families, and popu-\nlation groups. Differences among the states with respect to population character-\nistics, industrial economic base, eligibility for public insurance, and relative\npurchasing power of family income shape the geographic disparities in insur-\nance coverage rates (Figure ES.4) (Marsteller et al., 1998; Brown et al., 2000b;\nCunningham and Ginsburg, 2001).

Health insurance is a key\nfactor affecting whether an individual or family obtains health care. Uninsured\nAmericans are not able to realize the benefits of American health care because they\ncannot obtain certain services or the services they do receive are not timely,\nappropriate, or well coordinated.\nThe most apparent deficits in care experienced by those without insurance are\nfor chronic conditions and in preventive and screening services (Hafner-Eaton,\n1993; Ayanian et al., 2000; Baker et al., 2000; Schoen and DesRoches, 2000). Far\ntoo often, key aspects of quality health care, regular care and communication with\na provider to prevent and manage chronic health conditions (Institute of Medi-\ncine, 2001), are beyond the reach of uninsured persons.\nAs a society, we have tolerated substantial populations of uninsured persons as\na residual of employment-based and public coverage since the introduction of\nCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

People without health insurance are much more likely than in-\nsured persons to go without needed care, including preventive services and regu-\nlar care for chronic conditions, and are less likely to have a regular source of care.\nTo the extent that these measures of access are hallmarks of quality health care,\npeople without health insurance are at a disadvantage in obtaining high quality\ncare.\n\u2022 Americans persistently underestimate the size and diversity of the unin-\nsured population and the potentially adverse economic and health consequences\nof being uninsured. During 1999, approximately 40 million people in the United\nStates lacked health insurance coverage. Of these, almost all are under 65 years\nof age. More than 80 percent of uninsured children and adults under age 65 live in\nworking families. Although working improves the chances that one and one\u2019s fam-\nily will have insurance, members of families with two full-time wage earners have\nalmost a one-in-ten chance of being uninsured.\n\u2022 Most people, more than four out of five, choose to enroll in health insurance\nwhen it is offered on the job, including most lower-income workers and most young\nadults who work. Many of the uninsured have not been offered workplace cover-\nage, and some who are offered a plan cannot afford the premium.\n\u2022 Despite a variety of paths by which health insurance can be obtained\u2014\nthrough employment, through individual purchase, and through public programs\u2014\na substantial proportion of the United States population continues to lack health\ninsurance. The growth in the number of uninsured Americans has exceeded the\nrate of growth in the population under 65 over the past quarter century.\n\u2022 Health insurance serves multiple constituencies and distinct purposes. For\nindividuals and families, insurance is one means to promote health and plan for, if\nnot prevent, exceptional health care costs.

This report addresses the extent to\nwhich Americans are without coverage, identifies social, economic, and policy\nfactors that contribute to the existence and persistence of an uninsured population\nin the United States, and reports the probability for members of various popula-\ntion groups of being uninsured. In addition, it introduces a conceptual framework\nthat models how health insurance affects access to health care services and, through\nsuch access, affects health and economic well-being. This framework will guide\nthe analysis in succeeding reports in the series and will be modified to address each\nreport\u2019s set of topics.\nOBJECTIVES OF HEALTH INSURANCE\nCOVERAGE\nThe first step in identifying and measuring the consequences of\nbeing without health insurance and of high uninsured rates at the community level\nis to recognize that the purposes and constituencies served by health insurance are\nmultiple and distinct. These purposes include promoting health, obtaining health\ncare for individuals and families, and protecting people financially from excep-\ntional health care costs. Health insurance pools the risks and resources of a large\ngroup of people so that each is protected from financially disruptive medical\nexpenses resulting from an illness, accident, or disability. In addition to serving the\ntypical functions of risk insurance, health insurance has developed as a mechanism\nfor financing or pre-paying a variety of health care benefits, including routine\npreventive services, whose use is neither rare nor unexpected. Despite the fact that\na large proportion of persons with health insurance make claims against their\ncoverage every year, health care spending, and thus health insurance payouts,\nremain concentrated among a relatively small number of claimants, who incur\nhigh costs for serious conditions. Ten percent of the population accounts for 70", "summary": "The Committee\u2019s charge is to communicate to the public and policy makers about the meaning of a large uninsured population. It is not within the scope of this project to develop or advocate for a specific set of reforms or policies. Ten percent of the population accounts for 70 percent of U.S. health care costs."}, {"article": "WHY HEALTH INSURANCE MATTERS 21\nFrom the perspective of health care providers, insurance carried by their patients\nhelps secure a revenue stream, and communities benefit from financially viable\nand stable health care practitioners and institutions.\nEmployers offer health benefits both to attract and retain workers and to\nmaintain a productive workforce. Government provides health insurance to popu-\nlations whom the private market may not serve effectively, such as disabled and\nelderly persons, and populations whose access to health care is socially valued, such\nas children and pregnant women.\nThe ultimate ends of health insurance coverage for the individual and com-\nmunities, including workplace communities of employees and employers, are\nimproved health outcomes and quality of life. Attributing success in achieving\nthese goals to health insurance alone presents a challenge because isolating the\nrelative contribution of different determinants of individual and population health\nrequires a complex analysis. Over the past quarter of a century, the importance of\nhealth insurance has grown, as clinical medicine has become increasingly sophisti-\ncated, technological advances have become more commonplace, and the range of\ntherapeutic interventions (and their costs) has expanded rapidly. As a society, we\ninvest heavily in health insurance through direct personal expenditures, forgone\nwages, and tax policy. Health insurance in the United States has developed as a\ncommon but not universal component of the employment contract. Employees\nrank health insurance first by far in importance among all the benefits offered in\nthe workplace (Salisbury, 2001). Although there have been sizable investments of\npersonal and public funds to provide health insurance, many people still have no\ncoverage.\nMYTHS AND REALITIES ABOUT HEALTH\nINSURANCE\nDespite extensive reporting of survey findings and health care\nresearch results, the general public remains confused and misinformed about\nAmericans without health insurance and the implications of lacking coverage.\nThis section presents basic information about health insurance  and who lacks it in\nthe context of several pervasive popular myths. Without question, the complexity\nof American health care financing mechanisms and the wealth of sources of\ninformation add to the public\u2019s confusion and skepticism about health insurance\nstatistics and their interpretation. This report and those that will follow aim to\ndistill and present in readily understandable terms the extensive research that bears\non questions of health insurance coverage and its importance.\nMyth:U ninsured people get health care when they really need it.\nFifty-seven percent of Americans polled in 1999 believed that those without\nhealth insurance are \u201cable to get the care they need from doctors and hospitals\u201d\n(Blendon et al., 1999, p.207).

They also receive fewer preventive services and\nare less likely to have regular care for chronic conditions such as hypertension and\ndiabetes. Chronic diseases can lead to expensive and disabling complications if\nthey are not well managed (Lurie et al., 1984; Lurie et al., 1986; Ayanian et al.,\n2000). One national survey asked more than 3,400 adults about 15 highly serious\nor morbid conditions. Of those reporting any such symptoms (16 percent of those\nsurveyed), and with adjustment for demographic and economic characteristics,\nhealth status, and a regular source of care,\n1 an uninsured person was far less likely\nthan someone with insurance to receive care for the reported condition (odds ratio\n= 0.43) (Baker et al., 2000). Additional evidence is presented later in this chapter\nin the discussion of insurance and access to health care.\nMyth: People without health insurance are young and healthy and\nchoose to go without coverage. Almost half (43 percent) of those surveyed in\n2000 believed that people without health insurance are more likely to have health\nproblems than people with insurance. About as many (47 percent) thought the\nlikelihood of health problems is about the same for insured and uninsured people\n(NewsHour\u2013Kaiser, 2000). Voters and policy makers in focus group discussions\ncharacterize those without insurance as young people who have the opportunity\nto be covered and feel they do not need it (Porter Novelli, 2001).\nReality: Compared to those with at least some private coverage, the\nuninsured are less likely to report being in excellent or very good health\n(Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2001). In contrast, people report-\ning excellent or very good health are more likely to be insured. Among those\nunder  age 65 who are in fair or poor health, nearly one in five lacks health\ninsurance (Rhoades and Chu, 2000). Of young adults (ages 19\u201334 years) in poor\nhealth, 16 percent are uninsured and 27 percent of those reporting fair health\nstatus are uninsured (Figure 1.1) (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,\n2001).\nYoung adults between 19 and 34 are far more likely to lack health insurance\nthan any other age group. This is chiefly because they are less often eligible for\nemployment-based insurance due to the nature of their job or their short tenure in\nit. They are also more likely than older adults to be in excellent or very good\nhealth and consequently may forgo the cost of workplace coverage if it is offered.\nTurning down a workplace offer is not, however, a significant factor in explaining\ntheir lack of coverage. Younger workers accept workplace offers of coverage more\noften than not, and only 4 percent of all workers between 18 and 44 years of age,\n1\u201cRegular source of care\u201d is defined as the place or provider from which one usually seeks care or", "summary": "The uninsured are much more likely to forgo needed care.

Another 11 million uninsured workers between the ages of\n18 and 44 (15 percent) hold jobs that do not include an offer of coverage.\nThe perception that people without insurance have better-than-average health\nfollows from confusing the relatively young age profile of the uninsured with the\nbetter health, on average, of younger persons. This obscures the link between\nhealth status and health insurance.  For those without access to workplace health\ninsurance, poor health is a potential barrier to purchasing nongroup coverage\nbecause such coverage may be highly priced, exclude preexisting conditions, or be\nsimply unavailable. Older women  (55\u201364 years) in the work force are especially\nat risk of being uninsured for this reason: 23 percent of those in good, fair, or poor\nhealth have no coverage compared to 10 percent of those in excellent or very\ngood health (Monheit et al., 2001).\nMyth: The number of uninsured Americans is not particularly large\nand has not changed in recent years.  Seven out of ten respondents in a\nnationally representative survey thought that fewer Americans lacked health insur-\nance than actually do (Fronstin, 1998). Roughly half (47 percent) believed that the\nnumber of people without health insurance decreased or remained constant over\nthe latter half of the last decade (Blendon et al., 1999).\nReality: During 1999, an estimated 42 million people in the United\nStates lacked health insurance coverage (Mills, 2000).

This drop\nof almost 2 million in the number of people without insurance (a reduction of\nabout 4 percent) is certainly a positive change. With a softer economy in 2000 the\nlatest reported gains in insurance coverage may not continue (Fronstin, 2001).\nThe decline in the number of uninsured will not continue if the economy remains\nslow and health care costs continue to outpace inflation.  Due to the lag in\nmeasurement and reporting, however, the Census Bureau estimate of health in-\nsurance coverage for 2000 may show a further decline in the uninsured rate. This\nis because the data were collected for a period of strong economic performance.\nOf the estimated 42 million people who were uninsured, all but about 420,000\n(about 1 percent) were under 65 years of age, the age at which most Americans\nbecome eligible for Medicare;\n2 32 million were adults between ages 18 and 65,\nabout 19 percent of all adults in this age group; and 10 million were children\nunder 18 years of age, about 13.9 percent of all children (Mills, 2000). Through-\nout this report, the discussion focuses on these uninsured working-age adults and\nchildren.\nThese estimates of the number of persons uninsured are generated from the\nannual March Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS), conducted\nby the Census Bureau. Unless otherwise noted, national estimates of people with-\nout health insurance and proportions of the population with different kinds of\ncoverage are based on the CPS, the most widely used source of estimates of\ninsurance coverage and uninsurance rates. Seven different governmentally and\nprivately sponsored surveys can, however, be used to make nationally representa-\ntive estimates of the number of people without health insurance. These surveys\nand the estimates they yield are described briefly in Table B.1 in Appendix B.\nThese surveys differ in size and sampling methods, the questions that are asked\nabout insurance coverage, and the time period over which insurance coverage or\nuninsurance is measured (Lewis et al., 1998, Fronstin, 2000a). Each survey pro-\nduces a different estimate of the number of Americans without insurance. The\nestimates range from 32 million (e.g., Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 1996,\nuninsured throughout the year) to 42 million (CPS, 1999, uninsured throughout\nthe year).\n3\nThe CPS has been criticized for producing estimates of persons uninsured\n2Medicare, the federal insurance program for the elderly, disabled, and those with end-stage renal\ndisease, provides almost universal coverage for hospital care for those over age 65.  A small fraction of\nthe elderly do not qualify for the program because they do not have sufficient Social Security work", "summary": "The number of people without health insurance fell by almost 2 million in 1999.

The Census Bureau has\nrecently revised its survey questionnaire to include an additional question verify-\ning that the respondent means to report lack of coverage over the entire previous\nyear (see Appendix B for further explanation).  Still, the CPS is especially useful\nbecause it produces annual estimates relatively quickly, reporting the previous\nyear\u2019s insurance coverage estimates each September, and because it is the basis for\na consistent set of estimates for more than 20 years, allowing for analysis of trends\nin coverage over time. For these reasons, as well as the extensive use of the CPS in\nother studies of insurance coverage that are presented in this report, we rely on\nCPS estimates, with limitations noted. The Committee finds the variation among\nestimates of the number of persons uninsured produced by the different surveys\nless critical to its analysis than the order of magnitude of the range of estimates that\nthese surveys yield.\nThe estimate of the number of uninsured people expands when a population\u2019s\ninsurance status is tracked for several years. Over a three-year period beginning\nearly in 1993, 72 million people, 29 percent of the U.S. population, were without\ncoverage for at least one month. Within a single year (1994), 53 million people\nexperienced at least a month without coverage (Bennefield, 1998a).\nMyth: Most people who lack health insurance are in nonworking\nfamilies. An April 2000 national telephone survey by the NewsHour with Jim\nLehrer\u2013Kaiser Family Foundation found that 57 percent of the adults polled\nbelieved that most people without health insurance were unemployed or from\nfamilies with unemployed adults (News Hour\u2013Kaiser, 2000). Other surveys report\ncomparable findings  (Blendon et al., 1999; Wirthlin Worldwide, 2001).\nReality: More than 80 percent of uninsured children and adults un-\nder the age of 65 live in working families. Six out of every ten uninsured\nadults are themselves employed. Although working does improve the likelihood\nthat one and one\u2019s family members will have insurance, it is not a guarantee.  Even\nmembers of families with two full-time wage earners have almost a one-in-ten\nchance of being uninsured (9.1 percent uninsured rate) (Hoffman and Pohl, 2000).\nSee Chapter 3, especially Figures 3.1 and 3.2, for further details.\nMyth: New immigrants account for a substantial proportion of\npeople without health insurance. One analysis has attributed a significant\nportion of the recent growth in the size of the U.S. uninsured population to\nimmigrants who arrived in the country between 1994 and 1998 (Camarota and\nEdwards, 2000).\nReality: Recent immigrants (those who came to the United States\nwithin the past four years) do have a high rate of being uninsured (46", "summary": "25 percent of the U.S. population is without health insurance.

Overall, noncitizens account for fewer than one in five uninsured\npersons (Mills, 2000).\nMyths and Policy Making\nPopular confusion about the facts of health insurance coverage and its\nimportance can hamper effective policy making, as can policy makers\u2019 uncertainty\nabout the interpretation of coverage trends and consequences. This report and\nthose that will follow aim to provide reliable information, useful to both the\npublic and policy leaders\u2014legislators, employers, program managers\u2014as they meet\nthe ongoing challenges of financing health care.\nTHE COMMITTEE\u2019S ANALYTIC STRATEGY\nMeasuring Impacts of Coverage\nHealth insurance coverage is a key element in most models that depict access\nto health care. The relationship between health insurance and access to care is well\nestablished, as documented later in this chapter. Although the relationship be-\ntween health insurance and health outcomes is neither direct nor simple, an\nextensive clinical and health services research literature links health insurance\ncoverage to improved access to care, better quality, and improved personal and\npopulation health status. The Committee\u2019s conceptual framework for considering\nthe extent and nature of these and additional effects of health insurance builds\nselectively upon the most widely used behavioral model of access to health services\n(Andersen, 1995; Andersen and Davidson 2001). The framework focuses primar-\nily on the economic, financial, and coverage-related factors that facilitate the use\nof health care services. The Committee uses the framework in this introductory\nreport to conceptualize various effects of health insurance and to provide an\noverview of the subsequent analyses in future reports (see Figure ES.2 and Appen-\ndix A for a further description of this model).\nThe Committee will use this conceptual model to identify, organize, and\nassess the evidence regarding important consequences of uninsurance, each of\nwhich will be the subject of a future report: individual health outcomes, family\nwell-being, community impacts, and economic costs for society as a whole. Figure\n1.2 depicts the relationship among the topics of the Committee\u2019s reports in terms\nof a series of overlapping circles. For example, the second report, on personal\nhealth outcomes for uninsured adults, is represented by the innermost circle of the\nfigure, while the third report, on family well-being, encompasses the subjects of\nthe second report but emphasizes a different unit of analysis, namely, the family.\nThe sixth report in the series will present information about strategies and initia-\ntives undertaken locally, statewide, or nationally to address the lack of insurance\nand its adverse impacts. Each of these planned reports is described briefly in\nChapter 4.\nCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Many policies also exclude specific services such as\nmental health treatment, long-term care, or prescription drugs. The problems\nfaced by the underinsured are in some respects similar to those faced by the\nuninsured, although they are generally less severe. Uninsurance and underinsur-\nance, however, involve distinctly different policy issues, and the strategies for\naddressing them may differ. Throughout this study and the five reports to follow,\nthe main focus is on persons with no health insurance and thus no assistance in\npaying for health care beyond what is available through charity and safety net\ninstitutions.\nINSURANCE AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE\nFor individuals and families, health insurance both enhances\naccess to health services and offers financial protection against high expenses that\nare relatively unlikely to be incurred as well as those that are more modest but are\nstill not affordable to some. Health insurance is a powerful factor affecting receipt\nof care because both patients and physicians respond to the out-of-pocket price of\nservices. Health insurance, however, is neither necessary nor sufficient to gain\naccess to medical services. Nonetheless, the independent and direct effect of health\ninsurance coverage on access to health services is well established. This section\ndocuments that research literature and presents the Committee\u2019s findings regard-\ning access to care.\nSubsequent Committee reports will build on this finding and evaluate evi-\ndence for the further relationship between insurance coverage and health out-\ncomes. Appendix A describes and depicts schematically the Committee\u2019s concep-\ntual model of this complex relationship, which is affected by a variety of personal,\neconomic, and social factors and health care processes that are in turn subject to\nmany influences.\nHealth Insurance Facilitates Access to Care\nMany people who lack health insurance will forgo the care they need until\ntheir condition becomes intolerable. Others will obtain the health care they need\neven without health insurance, by paying for it out of pocket or seeking it  from\nproviders who offer care free or at highly subsidized rates. For still others, health\ninsurance alone does not ensure receipt of care because of other nonfinancial\nbarriers, such as a lack of health care providers in their community, limited access\nto transportation, illiteracy, or linguistic and cultural differences. Nonetheless,\nhealth insurance remains a key factor in assuring access to health care.\nFormal research about uninsured populations in the United States dates to the\nlate 1920s and early 1930s when the Committee on the Cost of Medical Care\nproduced a series of reports about financing physician office visits and hospitaliza-\ntions.

These studies became the factual basis for legislation that was enacted\nas the Medicare and Medicaid amendments to the Social Security Act in 1965.\nSince the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid, health services research on\nuninsured populations has been sponsored federally and privately, at increasing\nlevels of support over time and using new survey tools and data sets (Somers and\nSomers, 1961; Numbers, 1979; Starr, 1982; Andersen and Anderson, 1999). The\nCensus Bureau started collecting detailed information about health insurance in\nthe latter half of the 1970s and the National Center for Health Services Research,\na predecessor to AHRQ, conducted the National Medical Care Expenditure\nSurvey (NMCES) in 1977, followed by the National Medical Expenditure Survey\n(NMES) in 1987 and AHRQ\u2019s Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS),\nlaunched and conducted annually since 1996. A summary of the major surveys\ncollecting health insurance and utilization information is presented in Appendix B.\nPopulation-based surveys have been used to examine access to health services\nby measuring components of primary care, such as number of physician visits and\nimmunization rates, sites of care (e.g., physician office, hospital outpatient depart-\nment, clinic), barriers to care (e.g., inability to pay), and unmet health needs (e.g.,\nhealth status, inability to obtain care when needed) (Andersen and Aday, 1978;\nAday et al., 1984; Lurie et al., 1984; Monheit et al., 1985; Lurie et al., 1986;\nHafner-Eaton, 1993; Newacheck et al., 1993; Himmelstein and Woolhandler,\n1995; Sox et al., 1998; Hsia et al., 2000; Kasper et al., 2000). The likelihood of\nhaving any physician visit within a year, the number of visits annually, and having\na regular source of care are well established measures of access. Empirical studies\nconsistently support the link between access to care and improved health out-\ncomes (Bindman et al., 1995; Starfield, 1995).\nHaving a regular source of care can be considered a predictor of access, rather\nthan a direct measure of it, when health outcomes are themselves used as access\nindicators. This extension of the notion of access measurement was made by the\nIOM Committee on Monitoring Access to Personal Health Care Services\n(Millman, 1993, p.33):\n\u201c[T]he committee defined access as follows: the timely use of personal health\nservices to achieve the best possible health outcomes. Importantly, this definition\nrelies on both the use of health services and health outcomes to provide yard-\nsticks for judging whether access has been achieved.\u201d\nThus, in Access to Health Care in America, the earlier IOM committee incorporated\nhealth outcomes into the definition of access. In this first report of the Committee", "summary": "In the 1950s, new studies of individual and family health expenditures were co-sponsored by the University of Chicago and the Health Information Foundation.

Population-based surveys have been used to examine access to health services."}, {"article": "30 COVERAGE MATTERS:  INSURANCE AND HEALTH CARE\nThe likelihood that those without health insurance lack a regular source of\ncare has increased substantially since 1977. In 1996, people without insurance\nwere 2.5 times more likely to lack a regular source of care than were the insured\n(Zuvekas and Weinick, 1999; Weinick et al., 2000). Children without insurance\nwere three times as likely as children with Medicaid coverage to have no regular\nsource of care (15 percent versus 5 percent), and uninsured adults were more than\nthree times as likely as either privately or publicly insured adults to lack a regular\nsource of care (35 percent versus 11 percent) (Haley and Zuckerman, 2000).\nThe benefits for children of having health insurance and a regular source of\ncare, in terms of routine physician visits and appropriate preventive care, are well\ndocumented (Lave et al., 1998; Newacheck et al., 1998; Haley and Zuckerman,\n2000). However, the impact of parents\u2019 health and health insurance on the well-\nbeing of their children has received attention only recently. Whether or not\nparents are insured appears to affect whether or not their children receive care\u2014\nas well as how much care\u2014even if the children themselves have coverage (Hanson,\n1998). The health of parents can affect their ability to care for their children and\nthe level of family stress. Worrying about their children\u2019s access to care is itself a\nsource of stress for parents.\nUninsured adults are less likely to receive health services, even for certain\nserious conditions. In a study described earlier (Baker et al., 2000), even after\nadjusting for differences in age, sex, income, and health status, uninsured people\nwere less than half as likely as insured persons to receive care for a condition that\nphysicians deemed highly serious and requiring medical attention. People without\ninsurance are also less likely than people with insurance to receive preventive\nservices and appropriate routine care for chronic conditions, even as the impor-\ntance of preventive care and the prevalence of chronic disease become more\nprominent elements within health care (Hafner-Eaton, 1993; Ayanian et al., 2000;\nInstitute of Medicine, 2001). Finally, those who lack health insurance are more\nlikely to be hospitalized for conditions that might have been avoided with timely\nambulatory care (Weissman et al., 1992; Kozak et al., 2001).\nThe level of out-of-pocket costs for care has been demonstrated in random-\nized trials, natural experiments, and observational studies to have substantial effects\non the use of health care services (Newhouse et al., 1993; Zweifel and Manning,\n2000). Table 1.1 gives a sense of the magnitude of these costs. Uninsured patients\nmay be charged more than patients with coverage, who benefit from discounts\nnegotiated by their insurer, which amplifies the financial impact of lacking cover-\nage (Wielawski, 2000; Kolata, 2001).\nDifferential Access to Care for the Uninsured", "summary": "The impact of parents\u2019 health and health insurance on the well-being of their children has received attention only recently.

In one respect, health care is\nviewed as a market commodity, whose efficiency of production and consumption\ndepends on the discipline of market forces. Alternatively, health care is understood\nto be a social good, something that all members of our society should be able to\nobtain when they need it. This tension has contributed to the varied and complex\nset of arrangements to finance the delivery of health services that has developed\nincrementally in response to specific populations and problems with access to\nhealth care (Stevens, 1989; Stone, 1993). As a result of this piecemeal approach,\nabout 40 million Americans find themselves without insurance coverage each\nyear, and millions more are uninsured at some point when measured over longer\nperiods of time (Bennefield, 1998a; Mills, 2000).\nHealth insurance in the United States is a voluntary matter, yet many people\nare involuntarily without coverage. The cost of coverage limits feasible options for\nmost individuals and families. Employers and government agencies also must make\nstrategic choices about whether and how much coverage to offer. In addition, the\nunderwriting and marketing practices of the insurance industry further limit\u2014and\nat times eliminate\u2014options.\nWithin the private sector, coverage depends on an employer\u2019s decision to\noffer a health benefit plan and an employee\u2019s decision to enroll or take up this\noffer. Employers (and unions) decide whether to sponsor health benefits for some\nor all of their work force (on the basis of work status or occupation), how much\nto subsidize each worker\u2019s insurance premium (if at all), and whether to self-insure\nor purchase coverage from a third party.

Most employees of-\nfered coverage choose to accept (83 percent) and to pay their portion of the\ninsurance premium, resulting in an overall rate of 63 percent of all workers insured\nthrough their employment-based plan (Fronstin, 2001).\nWhen workers are not offered the option to purchase employment-based\ninsurance for themselves and their dependent family members (spouses and minor\nchildren), or if they decline to enroll, they may have no other alternatives for\ncoverage.

Participation in\npublic insurance such as Medicaid and the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance\nProgram (SCHIP) hinges on eligibility, which is means-tested and limited to\nspecific categories of people\u2014for example, children and pregnant women, and\npeople certified as having a permanent disabling condition. Except for Part A of\nthe federal Medicare program (hospital insurance), which ensures coverage of\nalmost all persons 65 years and older, an individual\u2019s participation in publicly\nsponsored health insurance is optional.\n The federally sponsored Medicaid program and SCHIP are structured as\noptions for states and eligible individuals. States may receive federal matching\nfunds by establishing a program that fulfills certain national eligibility, benefit, and\nreimbursement standards, or they may forgo federal dollars if they choose not to\nadminister programs that meet these federal standards. All of the states have chosen\nto operate both types of programs, and each state determines its own income and\nother eligibility criteria within federal statutory limits. One result of the historical\nconnection between Medicaid and income support programs for low income\nfamilies with children has been that coverage rates for childless low income adults\nhave lagged behind those for children.

Espe-\ncially for those who do not obtain employment-based coverage, the paths that lead\nto enrolling and staying enrolled in a health plan include potential barriers to\ncoverage.\nEmployment-Based Insurance Covers Two-Thirds of the\nPopulation Under Age 65\nMost Americans under age 65 obtain health insurance through their employ-\ners or as the dependent spouse or child of a wage earner with employment-based\ncoverage. Employment-based health benefits plans became more common in the\n1940s and until the mid-1970s the proportion of the population covered by health\ninsurance rose, at times dramatically (Starr, 1982; Numbers, 1985). Since the mid-\n1970s, however, the growth of per capita health services spending has outstripped\ngrowth in personal income (real wages) and revealed the limits of employment-\nbased coverage.\nThe rising cost of health insurance policies has become prohibitive for some\nemployers and workers, particularly those in small firms, and for employees at\nlower wage levels (Kronick and Gilmer, 1999). In the midst of the recent eco-\nnomic boom and low unemployment, the proportion of small- to medium-sized\nfirms (3\u2013199 employees) offering health insurance actually rose, from 54 to 67\npercent (Fronstin, 2001). These gains, however, are vulnerable not only to the\ngeneral state of the economy but also to continued increases in premiums (Fronstin,\n2001).\nVirtually all large employers offer health benefits to at least some of their\nworkforce. Health insurance gives them a way to offer a tax-subsidized benefit\nthat employees value enough to forgo a higher salary or income. Further, employ-\ners can take advantage of economies of scale and risk pooling to provide this group\nhealth benefit, which employees cannot match on their own.  Employers respond\nto a variety of considerations when deciding whether to offer health benefits to\ntheir workers and under what terms  the offer will be made. The price of coverage\nis critical to the employer\u2019s decision. The annual total cost for an average health\npolicy at work is $2,426 for individual and $6,351 for family coverage in 2000.\nThis represents a cost of doing business that is influenced by federal tax policies,\nregional health services markets, and the underwriting practices and vitality of\nregional and local insurance markets.\nWhen a firm provides a health insurance benefit, it may choose to withhold it\nfrom some of its employees. Some firms offer the benefit only to employees who\nwork full-time or have been with the firm for a minimum period.

According to the economic theory of\ncompensating differentials, the wage level required to attract workers will be\nlower when employers provide subsidized health insurance than it would be if\nemployers did not offer a subsidy. As a result, economists expect that workers\nimplicitly \u201cpay\u201d for at least part of their health insurance subsidy by receiving\nlower wages than they would otherwise receive (Currie and Madrian, 1999).\nIndividual Policies Fill Part of the Coverage Gap\nHealth insurance purchased by individuals outside the employment-based\ngroup context is, on average, more expensive to obtain, less consistent a product\ndue to a varied mix of offerings, and unavailable to many people who are, as one\nrecent study concluded, in \u201cless-than-perfect health\u201d (Pollitz et al., 2001). About\n16 million children and working-age adults were covered by individually issued,\nnongroup policies in 1999, or almost 7 percent of the population under age 65\n(Fronstin, 2000d). Substantial numbers of enrollees are drawn from the self-\nemployed and agricultural workers, persons who retire before becoming eligible\nfor Medicare, part-time and contingent workers, those who lose coverage through\na spouse, and young adults who grow too old to be covered under a parent\u2019s\nhealth coverage (Pollitz et al., 2001; GAO, 1996). While 30 to 40 percent of these\nenrollees participate for less than a year, to fill coverage gaps created by a change\nin economic or other life circumstances, over half of those who purchase indi-\nvidual policies do so as a more permanent source of coverage (Chollet and Kirk,\n1998).\nPremiums for insurance purchased through a small group or the individual\nmarket are more expensive, on average, than employment-based coverage.\n3 A\ncombination of adverse selection (the greater-than-average likelihood that indi-\nviduals and families with health problems will purchase coverage rather than be\nuninsured), lesser precision in predicting expenditures due to the small size of the\nrisk pool, and higher administrative costs make the \u201cloading factor\u201d (premiums\n3One study, for example, assumes that the premium cost for individually purchased coverage is 20\npercent greater than the employee\u2019s cost for employment-based coverage (Gabel et al., 1998).

Medical\nunderwriting practices applied to individual applicants for nongroup coverage\nmean that, compared with employment-based coverage, eligibility is more sensi-\ntive to an applicant\u2019s health status, age, family income, and geographic area of\nresidence (Chollet and Kirk, 1998). For example, one recent study of eight\nnongroup insurance markets found that the premium price for individual policies\nwas increased by 38 percent for persons with health problems, compared with a\nprice quote for a person without health problems (Pollitz et al., 2001). In addition,\nmost states allow risk rating for age, which means that individual policies tend to\nbe steeply price adjusted by age, making individual policies relatively expensive for\nolder people (Chollet and Kirk, 1998; Blue Cross Blue Shield, 2000).\nFederal and state reforms of the small group and individual markets have\nrestricted the use of medical underwriting to exclude applicants from eligibility,\nalthough these reforms usually do not restrict the premium prices that may be\ncharged for such coverage and in some cases have resulted in increased premium\nprices (Pollitz et al., 2001). The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability\nAct of 1996 (HIPAA) establishes certain rights to individually purchased coverage\nfor a limited group of eligible persons who formerly were covered by employ-\nment-based plans (Nichols and Blumberg, 1998). However, there is no regulation\nof the premiums that insurers may charge HIPAA-eligible individuals.\nAnother HIPAA requirement, that an insurance product be guaranteed to be\navailable to all, regardless of health status (so-called guaranteed issue), has been\naccompanied in some states by premium rating reforms. But even these reforms\nonly partially address insurers\u2019 reluctance to incur adverse risk selection (Hall,\n2000; Swartz, 2000). In a study of seven states where reforms to minimize the\nimpact of health status on rates included rating bands and modified or pure\ncommunity rating, insurers responded by dividing small groups into blocks of\nbusiness to re-introduce medical underwriting indirectly, by means of rate adjust-\nments allowed for distinguishing differences in benefits, age, the family size to be\ncovered, and geographic location (Hall, 2000).\nThe individual market may limit benefits for or exclude persons with chronic", "summary": "More than half of the population covered under individually purchased insurance live in families with incomes higher than 300 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) Some applicants are priced out of the market for individual coverage.

Medicare provides\nvirtually universal coverage for hospital and outpatient medical services for those\nover 65.\nQualifying to participate in Medicaid or SCHIP involves fulfilling require-\nments related to income and assets (making these so-called means-tested programs)\nand being a member of a specific group that is eligible for benefits, for example,\npregnant women, minor children, the elderly, and some of the permanently\ndisabled. Those who meet economic and group criteria must also meet immigra-\ntion status and residency requirements. Eligibility standards vary by state, with\ngeneral oversight provided by the federal government. Medicaid covers approxi-\nmately 41 million people, of whom about half are under the age of 21 and\nbetween 13 million and 14 million are parents and disabled adults under age 65\n(Health Care Financing Administration, 2001, 1998 data). Thus, Medicaid covers\napproximately 15 percent of the population under age 65 for at least part of each\nyear. Medicaid also provides supplemental benefits for about 5 million low-in-\ncome Medicare beneficiaries.\nFederal welfare reform legislation passed in 1996 severed the connection\nbetween eligibility for income benefits, such as Aid to Families with Dependent\nChildren (AFDC) and Supplemental  Security Income (SSI), and Medicaid cover-\nage.

Medicaid eligibility expansions since the late 1980s have offset some, but\nnot all, of the decline in employment-based insurance coverage that occurred\nbefore 1994 (Holahan and Kim, 2000). Without these Medicaid expansions, it is\nestimated that an additional 11 million people would have been uninsured\n(Carrasquillo et al., 1999a).\nWith expansions of Medicaid eligibility and the implementation of SCHIP, a\ncertain percentage of uninsured persons who were eligible for employment-based\nhealth insurance, and insured persons who had such coverage, may have chosen to\nenroll in public insurance instead. In addition, some employers may have been less\nlikely to offer dependent coverage to their lower-waged workers, knowing that\npublicly subsidized insurance was available for children. The extent of this so-\ncalled \u201ccrowding out\u201d or substitution of privately purchased coverage by public\ninsurance has been estimated in a number of studies, none of which is fully\ncomparable in terms of methods, data sources, or questions asked (Alteras, 2001;\nCutler and Gruber, 1997;  Dubay, 1999). For the Medicaid expansions, early\nestimates of crowd-out approaching 50 percent (Cutler and Gruber, 1996 a,b)\nhave been challenged on methodological grounds. More recent estimates have\nbeen as low as 4 percent, with upper bounds between 17 percent and 23 percent,\ndepending on how crowd-out is defined and measured (Alteras, 2001; Cutler and\nGruber, 1997; Blumberg et al., 2000; Dubay, 1999; Thorpe and Florence, 1998;\nYazici and Kaestner, 2000).\nEvidence of the substitution or \u201ccrowd-out\u201d of private insurance by public\ninsurance has informed public policy debates about the importance of balancing\npotentially negative outcomes of expanded eligibility for public insurance with\npositive outcomes including increased enrollment in insurance, particularly for\nchildren; decreased financial pressure on lower-income family budgets; and an\nimproved level of covered benefits for working families (Alteras, 2001;  Dubay\nand Kenney, 2001;  Lutzsky and Hill, 2001;  Swartz, 1996). For example, in the\ncase of SCHIP, there is concern not to single out for unfair treatment those\nfamilies who have valued coverage highly enough to purchase coverage for their\nchildren at a high cost, by denying them entry into publicly subsidized insurance\n(Swartz, 1996).\nPopular belief that Medicaid expansions resulted in a substantial crowding out\nof employment-based coverage has influenced the design and functioning of\nSCHIP, reflecting a tension between efforts to diminish substitution while boost-\ning enrollment (Lutzsky and Hill, 2001).

Federal regulations require state planning to minimize crowd-out and regu-\nlation of plans to subsidize employment-based insurance premiums (Lutzsky and\nHill, 2001). State responses have included waiting periods (the most common,\nabout two-thirds of all states), screening to determine whether applicants are\neligible for private insurance, cost-sharing (e.g., premiums for families above 150\npercent FPL) where SCHIP is not part of  Medicaid, and direct regulation of\ninsurers or employers (Lutzky and Hill, 2001).  In some states, there are exceptions\nmade for situations where employment-based insurance premiums are unaffordable\nor when individuals or families experience a change in insurance or economic\nstatus (Lutzsky and Hill, 2001).\nSince 1997, concern about SCHIP substituting for or crowding out employ-\nment-based coverage has diminished and the limits of experience with Medicaid\nexpansions in predicting the future of SCHIP have been acknowledged. Many\npublic officials have concluded that crowd-out is not an issue for families earning\nless than 150 percent of FPL, and just 3 to 8 percent of SCHIP applicants are\nturned down because they were eligible for private coverage or enrolled in private\ncoverage (Lutzsky and Hill, 2001).\nPublic Policies Shape the Marketplace for Health Insurance\nFederal tax policy gives favorable treatment to employment-based health\ninsurance.\n4 The employer\u2019s share of the premium is excluded from the employee\u2019s\ntaxable income. If the firm has a qualified flexible benefit plan, employees can pay\ntheir share of the premium with pre-tax dollars. Recent federal tax legislative\nreforms now allow self-employed people to claim a deduction for a share of their\nhealth insurance premiums, and full deductibility of the premiums of self-em-\nployed workers is being phased in. For the year 2000, the exclusion of employer\ncontributions from both federal income and Social Security taxes, together with\nsmaller exemptions and deductions for health care spending from personal income\ntaxes, resulted in a federal subsidy estimated at $125.6 billion (Sheils et al., 1999).\nThis represents a sizable federal expenditure for the support of employment-based\nhealth insurance.

This tax subsidy benefits families with high\nincomes more than those with low incomes because the amount of the subsidy is\nrelated directly to an individual\u2019s tax rate and those with higher incomes face\nhigher marginal tax rates.

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act\nof 1974 (ERISA) mandates that certain group health benefits offered through the\nworkplace be considered under federal pension law rather than state insurance\nregulations (EBRI, 2000). One recent change in this pattern of jurisdiction lies in\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA),\nwhich has resulted in most states providing guaranteed issue of at least one health\ninsurance plan, guaranteeing renewal for certain policy holders in all states, and\nrestricting preexisting condition exclusions by statute for individuals who are\nleaving employment-based plans (HIPAA-eligible persons) (Chollet and Kirk,\n1998). Fourteen states require that insurers guarantee the issue of at least one\nproduct to all applicants, although some of these states impose restrictions on\nqualified applicants. Eighteen states have imposed some kind of limitations on\nvariations in premiums or prohibited the use of certain rating factors such as age,\ngender, claims experience, or health status (Pauly and Percy, 2000).\nHOW PEOPLE GAIN AND LOSE COVERAGE\nMany conventional and economic transitions over the course of\na lifetime can result in a loss of health insurance coverage for a person or family\nbecause income, health status, marital status, and terms of employment can influ-\nence eligibility for and participation in health insurance. An illness or accident\nserious enough to interrupt work and income, the loss of one\u2019s job, divorce from\nor death of a spouse whose employment provided family health benefits, or\nretirement from work before age 65 (when Medicare eligibility begins) can result\nin the loss of insurance. When children reach age 18 or leave college, they usually\nlose public benefits or coverage under their parent\u2019s health insurance plan. Increas-\ning one\u2019s income, even if barely above the eligibility limit, may result in a total loss\nof Medicaid coverage, even if workplace health benefits are not available or\naffordable.

As a result, both the stability of insurance coverage\nand the length of uninsured periods have the potential to affect the health and\nfinancial well-being of individuals, families, and communities.\nLongitudinal surveys provide the basis for estimating the prevalence and\nduration of uninsured spells. During 1994, the latest year for which the Survey of\nIncome and Program Participation  (SIPP) results are available, an estimated 53\nmillion Americans, or 21 percent of the population under age 65, were uninsured\nfor at least one month (Bennefield, 1998a).

The authors of this study concluded that\npolicies to address the problem of uninsurance need to take into account the\nprecipitating factors in losing and gaining coverage as well as the income, work-\nplace and personal characteristics often associated with periods of uninsurance of\nvarying lengths (Swartz et al., 1993a). Policy interventions need to be designed\nwith an awareness of the populations and problems that they ultimately affect:\neither those who experience short periods without coverage or persons who\nremain uninsured for longer intervals. Often a single strategy does not address both\nkinds of problems (Short and Klerman, 1998).\nPeople who previously had individual insurance account for more than half of\nall uninsured periods, perhaps because the cost of individual insurance is relatively\nhigh and may become unaffordable or because an insurance company refuses to\nrenew a policy if the holder becomes a bad risk. Those who lose employment-\nbased coverage account for only one-third of uninsured periods (Jensen, 1992).\nThis is notable given that more than two-thirds of the public have employment-\nbased coverage and only 7 percent have individual coverage. Young adults age\n18\u201324, workers with job interruptions, and persons in lower-income families (less\nthan 200 percent of FPL) all have roughly a 50 percent chance of going without\nhealth coverage for at least one month during a three year period (Bennefield,\n1998a). Children, young adults, persons with some college education, and full-\ntime workers tend to experience shorter periods uninsured than do adults who\nhave not attended college or who work part-time, are unemployed, or are not in\nthe labor force (Bennefield, 1998a).\nLow-income uninsured persons tend to stay uninsured for longer than those\nwith higher incomes. The typical or median time period without coverage for\nsomeone below the FPL is significantly longer than for all other persons\u2014more\nthan 8 months compared with 6 months (McBride, 1997).\nCoverage is particularly episodic for lower income women. Medicaid enroll-\nment periods for single women tend to be short; more than half maintain enroll-\nment for less than one year, not quite one-third last more than two years, and only\n15 percent last longer than five years. One study of a sample of unmarried women\nbetween the ages of 19 and 44 found that one-third of all new Medicaid enrollees\nhad private health insurance just prior to enrolling in Medicaid (Short and Freed-\nman, 1998). Among former welfare recipients who lost Medicaid benefits, one\nyear after leaving welfare 28\u201338 percent had private coverage, 36\u201349 percent were\nuninsured, and 22\u201326 percent had returned to Medicaid (Garrett and Holahan,\n2000; Short and Freedman, 1998).\nCONSTRAINED COVERAGE OPTIONS\nThe substantial cost of health insurance means that employers", "summary": "People who previously had individual insurance account for more than half of uninsured periods.

The average cost of a family policy in an employment-\nbased group was $6,351 per year in 2000 (Kaiser\u2013HRET, 2000). The price for a\nparticular insurance policy may be affected by insurance company practices rang-\ning from risk-rating (based either on the group\u2019s experience or medical underwrit-\ning) to restrictions on coverage of specific persons, populations, conditions, or\nepisodes. The price of the insurance premium offered to a firm reflects a number\nof considerations, including firm size, whether it is unionized, the employment\nsector, and federal tax policies. In addition, an insurance company may decline to\noffer or to renew a group policy at all, based on decisions related to underwriting\npractices. Group health insurance premiums vary geographically, with the highest\nindividual and family coverage premiums occurring in the Northeast region, and\nthe lowest in the West. This regional variation amounts to about 15 percentage\npoints around the national average premium price (Kaiser\u2013HRET, 2000).\nEmployers have used direct and indirect means to constrain their health\ninsurance costs. Although the share of the health insurance premium paid directly\nby the employee varies from none to all, workers on average pay 14 percent of the\ncost of individual coverage and 27 percent of the cost of family coverage (Kaiser\u2013\nHRET, 2000). From 1979 through 1995, when the cost of health services rose\nmore quickly than did real income, one common employer response to price\nincreases was to reduce the size and proportion of their subsidy of their employees\u2019\nhealth insurance premiums, with lower-wage workers experiencing the greatest\ndecline in subsidy (Medoff et al., 2001). For example, between 1988 and 1996, the\nproportion of the average worker\u2019s share for single coverage increased from 10\npercent to 22 percent (GAO, 1997a). The proportion paid for family coverage\nincreased more slowly, from 26 percent to 30 percent (and from 34 to 44 percent\nfor coverage offered by small to medium-sized firms), although the dollar cost of\nthe average worker\u2019s share for family coverage increased more than for single\ncoverage, an 111 percent increase compared with a 79 percent increase for single\ncoverage (Gabel et al., 1997; GAO, 1997a). Since 1996 the trend has been toward\nsmaller proportional and absolute premium payments by employees for individual\ncoverage and roughly steady employee contributions for family coverage (Kaiser\u2013\nHRET, 2000). Also, fewer employers are extending coverage to retirees, who, if\nthey retire before age 65, must find an individual policy to cover them until they", "summary": "The cost and availability of group policies to employers reflects the gamut of insurance company practices, state regulations, and constraints imposed by ERISA and HIPAA.

Insurers may decline to write policies, or write relatively\nexpensive ones, for small to midsized firms in particular employment sectors such\nas seasonal workers or hazardous occupations (Weissman and Epstein, 1994).\nBecause wage rates tend to be lower in smaller firms, the financial strain on both\nemployers and workers is increased (Gabel, 1999). As a result, some small employ-\ners simply decline to offer coverage. Among small businesses surveyed, the most\ncommon and highest-ranking reason for not offering insurance benefits was the\nexpense of coverage (Fronstin and Helman, 2000).\nDifficult Choices for Individuals\nFinancial concerns constrain a person\u2019s decision to enroll in employment-\nsponsored coverage or to purchase individual health insurance. The choice the\nindividual or family makes reflects the value decision makers place on avoiding\nrisk, their beliefs or expectations about future health care needs and costs, the\nanticipated out-of-pocket costs (including any premiums and copayments), and\nthe ability of the family to pay such costs. The choice reflects, in part, a compari-\nson of employee premium costs and health care costs not covered by the policy,\nwhich constitute the individual\u2019s or family\u2019s out-of-pocket expenditures, with\nwhat they expect to incur in total health care costs, plus some allowance for the\ndesire to avoid the risk of higher payments absent insurance. It also reflects the\nvalue of health services relative to other goods and services the family needs, such\nas food, rent, and utilities. Estimates of consumers\u2019 responsiveness to changes in\nthe price of health insurance based on the choices of workers without employ-\nment-based coverage reveal that such purchase decisions are not very sensitive to\nprice (Marquis and Long, 1995).\n5\nThe expense of the insurance premiums paid by employees tops the list of\nreasons why uninsured workers decline to take employment-based insurance when\nit is offered (Cooper and Schone, 1997). Between 1979 and 1995, the proportion\nof workers who paid less than 5 percent of their family income for health care\nexpenditures (including expenses covered by private health insurance) declined by\nhalf, from about 50 percent to 26 percent, while the proportion of workers who\npaid over 10 percent of their family income increased by over half, from 20\npercent to 33 percent (Kronick and Gilmer, 1999).

Increases in the uninsured rate since the mid-1990s have been attributed\nto declines in public insurance and individually purchased coverage, despite in-\ncreases since 1993 in employment-based coverage (Holahan and Kim, 2000).\nUps and Downs in Public Program Enrollment\nFundamental changes in public policies have affected both the size and the\ncomposition of the uninsured population over the last 15 years. Expansions of\nMedicaid eligibility for children and pregnant women beginning in the mid-1980s\nboosted eligibility and, to a lesser degree, enrollments in state public insurance\nprograms. In the mid-1990s, enrollment in public insurance decreased sharply\nwith the enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Rec-\nonciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), which uncoupled Medicaid eligibility from\nincome support and placed new restrictions on legal immigrants\u2019 eligibility, in-\ncluding a five-year bar on participation by immigrants arriving after August 1996\n(Ku and Blaney, 2000; Rosenbaum, 2000; Guendelman et al., 2001; Holahan et\nal., 2001; Ku and Matani, 2001).\n7 Many lower-income parents (mostly women)\ndid not enroll because they either lost eligibility for Medicaid or believed that they\nwere no longer eligible because of their loss of income benefits  (Garrett and\nHolahan, 2000; Holahan, 2001). Although the PRWORA\u2019s provisions were\nintended to allow families to maintain health coverage after cash benefits ended,\nseparate enrollment processes for the two programs and confusion have contrib-\nuted to reduced Medicaid enrollments.\nSince the implementation of SCHIP, there has been some recovery of public\ncoverage for lower-income children. However, an estimated 94 percent of unin-\nsured children in lower-income families are eligible for public insurance but not\nfully enrolled: all but 400,000 of the estimated 7.1 million uninsured lower-\nincome children (Broaddus and Ku, 2000). SCHIP has experienced slow growth\nin its first years, and serious problems remain in reaching enrollment targets. While\n3.3 million children had been enrolled by October 2000, maintaining children\u2019s\nparticipation in SCHIP beyond the first enrollment period presents additional\nchallenges (Broaddus and Ku, 2000; Cunningham and Park, 2000).\nProspects for Employment-Based Coverage\nA continuation of the economic slowdown that began in late 2000, or a\nfurther softening of the labor market, could erase the modest gains made in\nemployment-based coverage since 1994 (GAO, 2001a).

Because of\nMedicare, persons over age 65 are rarely uninsured.\n\u2022 Just over half of all uninsured persons are non-Hispanic whites. Higher-\nthan-average uninsured rates among racial and ethnic minority groups and among\nrecent immigrants reflect lower rates of employment-based coverage and lower\nfamily incomes, on average, compared to non-Hispanic whites and U.S.-born res-\nidents.

Most of the studies that the Committee reviewed are based on two-way\n(bivariate) analyses of a characteristic and the probability that an individual with\nthat characteristic will be uninsured.\nThroughout the chapter, the Committee addresses two questions together:\n1. What are the characteristics of the uninsured population?\n2. Who is most likely to be uninsured?\nThe distribution of socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic differences\nin the general population under age 65 affects how these characteristics are distrib-\nuted among the uninsured population because the relative size of specific popula-\ntion groups affects their representation among the uninsured.

Yet more than half of the uninsured\nunder age 65 years are members of families with one full-time, full-year worker.\nFully 82 percent of uninsured persons are members of families with at least one\nwage earner (Hoffman and Pohl, 2000).\nAs discussed in Chapter 2, the rate of employment-based coverage has de-\nclined since the late 1970s, with wage earners in long-term, full-time positions\n(\u201ccore jobs\u201d) more likely to be insured than persons recently employed or work-\ning less than full-time (\u201cperipheral jobs\u201d) (Farber and Levy, 2000).

However, only some\nstates have adopted these higher standards. Few states offer enrollment to children\nin families earning more than 200 percent of FPL or to adults in families earning\nat least 100 percent of FPL. For this reason, persons from families with earnings\nbetween 100 and 199 percent of FPL are almost as likely to go without coverage\nas are people from families whose earnings are below 100 percent of FPL (Hoffman\nand Schlobohm, 2000). Expansions of the Medicaid program from the mid-1980s\nthrough the mid-1990s and the introduction of the State Children\u2019s Insurance\nPrograms (SCHIP) helped reduce the proportion of lower-income persons with-\nout health insurance from an estimated 38 percent in 1987 to an estimated 32\npercent in 1999. These expansions left unchanged the principle that nondisabled\npersons ages 18\u201364 may be eligible for Medicaid only when they are parents living\nin households with children.\nEducational Attainment\nMore than one-quarter of all uninsured adults have not earned a\nhigh school diploma. Almost four of every ten adults who have not\ngraduated from high school are uninsured.\nEmployment-based health insurance coverage is associated increasingly with\nthe presence of a college degree (Figures 3.5 and 3.6) (Gabel, 1999). In addition to\nbeing positively related to income, the attainment of a college degree is associated\nwith employment in certain sectors and types of jobs that are more likely than\nothers to include a health insurance benefit. Also, the worker\u2019s educational level\nhas a small effect on the take-up rate of insurance offers. The decline in employ-\nment-based coverage between 1977 and 1998 almost entirely affected primary\nwage earners who had not graduated from college and their dependents (Gabel,\n1999). Compared with a relatively steady 80 percent employment-based coverage\nrate for college graduates, high school graduates experienced a 5 percentage point\ndecline in employment-based coverage (from 68 percent to 63 percent insured)\nbetween 1977 and 1998. Primary wage earners who did not complete high school\nexperienced an 18 percentage point decline in employment-based coverage rate\n(from 52 percent to 34 percent) during this same time period. Years of education\nserve to protect against the loss of insurance for holders of core jobs but not for\ncontingent or recently hired workers (Farber and Levy, 2000).\nThis pattern is influenced by both labor force and employer characteristics\u2014\nfor example an  employer\u2019s willingness to offer a health benefit with affordable\npremiums or a subsidy.

Of those with high school diplomas or less education\nwho are offered and decline coverage however, more than a third (36 percent)\nremain uninsured, twice the rate of residual uninsurance as that of more highly\neducated workers who decline workplace coverage. Less educated workers who\ndecline coverage are less likely to gain coverage through a spouse than are more\neducated workers who decline coverage (Custer and Ketsche, 2000b). The de-\ncline in employment-based coverage of primary wage earners with less education\nmay be attributed to the expense of coverage, whereas workers with higher\neducational attainment may have other options for coverage.\nJob Characteristics\nThere are greater numbers of uninsured blue-collar workers than\nuninsured white-collar workers. Members of families with a primary\nwage earner who is blue collar are more likely to be uninsured than are\nmembers of families with a white-collar worker.\nIn addition to the job characteristics related to work status, the occupation of\na family\u2019s primary wage earner influences the likelihood that members will be\nuninsured (McDonnell and Fronstin, 1999). Uninsured rates vary dramatically\nwith regard to occupation:  while almost half of all wage-earners working in\nprivate households (maids and domestic laborers) are uninsured, less than 10\npercent of all wage earners in professional jobs are uninsured (McDonnell and\nFronstin, 1999).\nEmployer Characteristics\nWage-earners in smaller-sized firms, in lower-waged firms, in non-\nunionized firms, and in nonmanufacturing employment sectors are more\nlikely to go without coverage.\nOver the past decade, the overall increase in the number of uninsured persons\nin working families has reflected a variety of dynamics related to employment-\nbased coverage. There are greater numbers of uninsured workers employed by\nsmaller firms (fewer than 25 employees), compared to larger firms, more em-\nployed in predominantly lower-waged or nonunionized firms, and more em-\nployed in sales (\u201cwholesale and retail trade\u201d) compared to the profile of employers\nand industries that dominated the U.S. economy in the years after World War II\nwhen our present employment-based coverage arrangements became established\n(Gabel, 1999; Starr, 1982).\nEconomies of scale for employers in purchasing health benefit plans\u2014that is,\nlower costs per person for larger groups\u2014mean that firm size plays a key role in\ninfluencing the availability of employment-based coverage (Fronstin, 2000d;\nCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Two groups of adults are of particular concern, young adults (ages 18\nthrough 24 years) because of their high uninsured rate (29 percent) and midlife\nadults (ages 55 through 64 years) whose uninsured rate is lower than average (14\npercent) but whose family incomes have begun to decline, on average, and who\nhave a greater anticipated need for health services (Figure 3.12).\nYoung Adults (Ages 18 Through 24 Years)\nAlmost three out of every ten young adults do not have health insurance.\nMembers of this age group are nearly twice as likely to be uninsured compared to\nmembers of the general population under age 65. This higher-than-average prob-\nability has been the case since at least the mid-1980s, and the uninsured rate for\nthis group continues to increase over time (Rowland et al., 1998; Swartz, 1998;\nQuinn et al., 2000).\nOverrepresentation of young adults among the uninsured reflects social, eco-\nnomic, and demographic factors. Young adulthood is a period of transition from\nschool to work, likely to involve changes that may lead to gaps in health insurance\ncoverage. For young adults who are not wage earners, family income is a key\nfactor affecting their likelihood of being uninsured. Families covered by employ-\nment-based health insurance often extend coverage to children who are supported\nas full-time college students (usually through age 23).

Of the remaining 12 million young adults who are not full-time\ncollege students, almost two out of five persons are uninsured  (Quinn et al.,\n2000).\nSocial and economic factors present potential barriers to young adults trying\nto obtain coverage through employment-based plans. They are more likely to\nwork in smaller firms, more likely to hold entry-level or lower-waged jobs (less\nthan $10 per hour), and as a result, less likely to receive an offer of employment-\nbased coverage (Custer and Ketsche, 2000b; Quinn et al., 2000). When health\ninsurance is offered to young employees, it is more likely to require that the\nemployee pay a relatively high proportion of the costs. Take-up rates for young\nadults are lower than for the adult population overall, although estimates of the\ndifference vary with the data source and age ranges being compared (Cunningham,\n1999a; McDonnell and Fronstin, 1999; Custer and Ketsche, 2000b). Nonetheless,\nyoung adults do share the views of older adults that health insurance is important,\nand they cite the cost of premiums as the most important reason for deciding not\nto enroll in a health plan (Quinn et al., 2000). Some young people, likely those\nwith no option to buy coverage at work, buy individual coverage. One measure of\nthe value of coverage is the fact that this age group shows a higher-than-average\nrate for individually purchased coverage (Figure 3.13) (Fronstin, 2000d).\nMidlife Adults (Ages 55 Through 64 Years)\nMidlife adults are less likely to go without health insurance than are members\nof the population overall, yet their risk is of particular concern because of their\ncollective decline in income; their transition in work status from full-time, full-\nyear work to contingent labor or retirement; and their decline in health status,\naccompanied by increased spending for health services (GAO, 1998; Brennan,\n2000). During 1996, about one-third of midlife adults with family incomes under\n$10,000 were uninsured. For this age group, the uninsured rate dropped to less\nthan 10 percent only for those whose family income was at least $40,000.\nAdults between the ages of 55 and 64 are \u201cthe largest and most easily identi-\nfiable segment of the [medically] high-risk population,\u201d accounting for two-thirds\nof all deaths and more than one-third of all surgical procedures and hospital days\namong all adults under 65 years of age (Jensen, 1992). This is the age group most\nlikely to report fair or poor health status, the presence of chronic disease, or the\npresence of a limiting condition or disability (Jensen, 1992; Brennan, 2000). In\nthis age group, women are more likely than men to be uninsured and to suffer\nworse health (Monheit et al., 2001).\nGiven this age group\u2019s overall health status, the proportion of persons unin-\nsured would be even higher than observed were it not for higher-than-average", "summary": "Social and economic factors present potential barriers to young adults trying to obtain coverage through employment-based plans.

Men are significantly more likely to be covered by employment-\nbased insurance and Medicare (when certified as being permanently disabled or as\nhaving end-stage renal disease), while women are significantly more likely to be\ncovered by individual policies and by Medicaid (Brennan, 2000). Women\u2019s lower\nincomes contribute to greater Medicaid eligibility (Wyn et al., 2001).\nWidening gaps in employment-based retiree health coverage mirror the over-\nall decline in employment-based coverage. Over the past decade, there has been a\ndecline in the number of large firms offering health insurance coverage to retirees\n(Fronstin, 2001). A December 1990 change in standard accounting practice (Fed-\neral Accounting Standard 106) has made explicit and transparent to investors the\nlarge unfunded liabilities inherent in employers\u2019 promises of retiree benefits, dis-\ncouraging employers from offering a health insurance benefit to new retirees\n(GAO, 1998; Fronstin, 2001). Wage-earners who retire before age 65 because of\na health condition may find themselves uninsured if their employer does not offer\nretiree coverage, if the cost to continue enrollment in the employer\u2019s plan is\nprohibitive, or if individual insurance coverage is too costly or not available.\nChildren\nFederal and state policies have given high priority to providing health insur-\nance opportunities for children, yet the uninsured rate for children is almost 14\npercent and an estimated two-thirds of all uninsured children are believed to be\neligible for public insurance (Broaddus and Ku, 2000; Mills, 2000).\nBetween 1977 and 1996, the uninsured rate for children rose, consistent with\nthe decline in employment-based coverage for adults over the same period\n(Weinick and Monheit, 1999). From 1994 through 1998, half of the increase in\nthe number of uninsured children consisted of children from lower-income fami-\nlies (less than 200 percent of FPL) and the other half from families with at least a\nmoderate income level (at least 200 percent of FPL) (Holahan and Kim, 2000).\nBetween 1998 and 1999, when the coverage rate improved for the first time in\nmore than a decade, children accounted for 60 percent (1 million people) of the\noverall decline in the total number of uninsured people (Guyer, 2000).\nSince 1995 there has been a decline in the proportion of children covered by\nMedicaid, reflecting the impact of the 1996 welfare reform that uncoupled Med-\nicaid eligibility and enrollment from public income assistance (Broaddus and Ku,\n2000). Independent of the economic prosperity that began in the mid-1990s,\nwelfare reform is estimated to have caused a decline in public health insurance", "summary": "The uninsured rate for children is almost 14 percent.

Nonetheless almost all lower-income uninsured children\n(7 million) are eligible for either Medicaid or SCHIP (Broaddus and Ku, 2000).\nThere are continuing problems with program outreach, enrollment, and mainte-\nnance of enrollment (Broaddus and Ku, 2000; Cunningham and Park, 2000). By\n2002, all low-income children (family income less than 100 percent of FPL)\nshould be eligible for public insurance under either Medicaid or SCHIP (Broaddus\nand Ku, 2000). It is anticipated that SCHIP will reduce the proportion of children\nwho are uninsured as states more fully implement their programs and if current\nfunding streams are maintained or expanded (Selden et al., 1999).\nMarital Status\nThere are more unmarried than married adults among the ranks of\nthe uninsured. Unmarried persons are much more likely than are those\nwho are married to be uninsured.\nMarriage often serves as a protective factor against being uninsured; 29 per-\ncent of uninsured adults are married, while 35 percent of uninsured adults report\nthemselves as never having been married and 11 percent report themselves as\nbeing divorced (Rhoades and Chu, 2000). If both spouses in a married couple are\nwage earners, they have two potential chances to obtain coverage, through one\nspouse\u2019s employer or the other\u2019s. Furthermore, the family income of married\ncouples, like that of two-parent families, may reflect the contribution of more\nthan one wage-earner, giving a potential economic advantage in comparison with\nthe family incomes of single people and single parents. As a result, married couples\nmay be more likely to find that health insurance premiums are affordable (Figure\n3.14). The uninsured rate for two single adults living together (35 percent) is\nhigher than the uninsured rate either for single adults living alone (16 percent) or\nfor married adults without children (17 percent) (Hoffman and Schlobohm, 2000).\nYoung adults are less likely to be married and, thus, less likely to have the\nchance to obtain coverage through a spouse. Only 15 percent of young adults ages\n19 to 23 years are married and 3 percent are covered by their spouse (Quinn et al.,\n2000). For people aged 24 to 29 years, almost half are married and 11 percent\nreceive insurance coverage through a spouse, compared to those ages 30 to 64, of\nwhom two-thirds are married and 18 percent are covered by a spouse\u2019s policy.\nFamily Composition\nMore than half of all uninsured persons are members of families that\ninclude children, and more than half of all uninsured children live in\ntwo-parent families, comparable to their numbers in the general popu-\nlation. However, individuals in families without children are more likely\nto go without coverage than those in families that include children.\nThe fact that families with children are more likely to be insured may reflect\nthe slower rate of increase in insurance premium costs over time for employment-", "summary": "There are more unmarried than married adults among the ranks of uninsured.

Children in immigrant\nfamilies are more likely to be uninsured, whether or not their parents are citizens,\nalthough a child\u2019s status as a citizen reduces somewhat the probability of being\nuninsured (Brown et al., 1999). In lower-income working families, almost 20\npercent of all U.S.-born children are uninsured, while slightly more than 50\npercent of all foreign-born children are uninsured (Guendelman et al., 2001).\nRace and Ethnicity\nNon-Hispanic whites comprise about half of the uninsured, reflect-\ning their majority in the general population. Non-Hispanic African\nAmericans are twice as likely, and Hispanics three times as likely, as\nwhites to be uninsured.\nHigher uninsured rates among members of racial and ethnic minority groups\nare a consequence of lower rates of employment-based coverage and higher\nproportions of lower-income families within each group (Figures 3.19, 3.20, and\n3.21). These rates are only partially offset by higher rates of public insurance\ncoverage (Gabel, 1999; Brown et al., 2000a; Monheit and Vistnes, 2000; Shi,\n2000b). Since the late 1970s, members of racial and ethnic minority groups have\nexperienced a disproportionate decline in employment-based coverage (Gabel,\n1999). For Hispanics, the declining rate also reflects changes related to declining\nfamily income levels and lower levels of educational attainment (Monheit and\nVistnes, 2000). These changes are related to a shift in composition of the Hispanic\npopulation, with an increasing proportion comprised of immigrants from Central\nAmerica and Mexico (Gabel, 1999;  Monheit and Vistnes, 2000).\nHispanics\nMore than one-third of all Hispanics under age 65 are uninsured.\nMirroring the uninsured population as a whole, more than one-half of uninsured\nHispanics are members of families with at least one full-time, full-year worker, and\nmore than eight out of ten are members of households with at least one part-time\nworker (Quinn, 2000). From 1987 through 1996, the number of uninsured His-\npanics nearly doubled, reflecting both population growth and the decline of\nemployment-based coverage (Monheit and Vistnes, 2000; Quinn, 2000).\nThe high uninsured rate for Hispanics reflects the fact that Hispanic wage\nearners are much less likely than average to be offered employment-based cover-\nage and slightly more likely than non-Hispanic whites to decline to take up the\noffer (Cunningham, 1999a; Schur and Feldman, 2001).

Non-Hispanic whites\nin smaller firms are twice as likely to be offered coverage as are Hispanics (Quinn,\n2000). The high uninsured rate for Hispanics also reflects a lower-than-average\nrate of public coverage for members of lower-income families. In families that\nearn less than the FPL, 45 percent of all Hispanics are uninsured, compared with\n32 percent of non-Hispanic whites (Fronstin, 2000d).\nIn Hispanic families, 49 percent of members are covered by employment-\nbased insurance plans: 59 percent are offered the chance to purchase coverage, and\n83 percent take up this offer to enroll (Custer and Ketsche, 2000b). For members\nof families in which the primary wage earner is not offered employment-based\ncoverage, 10 percent obtain employment-based coverage through other means, 2\npercent purchase individual coverage, 23 percent obtain public insurance and 66\npercent remain uninsured. For family members of primary wage earners who\ndecline to purchase employment-based coverage, 34 percent receive employ-\nment-based coverage through other family members, 3 percent purchase indi-\nvidual coverage, 17 percent receive public insurance, and 46 percent remain\nuninsured (Custer and Ketsche, 2000b). The age distribution of Hispanics contrib-\nutes to the high numbers of uninsured; the Hispanic population has a higher\nproportion of younger persons than older ones, and more than half of all Hispanic\nyoung adults go without health insurance (Hoffman and Pohl, 2000; Quinn,\n2000).\nSocial and economic factors and nativity jointly contribute in important ways\nto the uninsured rate of the Hispanic population, because a significant proportion\nof this group are foreign-born or members of immigrant households. Among adult\nmale wage-earning Hispanics, for example, Puerto Ricans and Cuban Americans\nhave similar rates of private coverage, although Puerto Ricans have a higher\nemployment-based coverage rate while Cuban Americans have a higher rate of\nindividually purchased coverage (Fronstin et al., 1997). Mexican Americans have\nthe lowest rate of private coverage compared to Puerto Ricans and Cuban Ameri-\ncans, reflecting lower wage levels and lower levels of education on average for\nMexican Americans.\nIn addition, Hispanics who identify themselves as noncitizens are more than\ntwice as likely to go without health insurance (58 percent uninsured rate) as\nHispanic citizens (27 percent uninsured rate) (Brown et al., 2000a). If Hispanic\nchildren as a group had comparable citizenship and immigration status, parental\neducational attainment, work status, and family income as the rest of the popula-\ntion under age 18, they would still be more likely to be uninsured than non-\nHispanic white, African-American, and Asian-American children (Weinick and\nMonheit, 1999).\nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives", "summary": "Hispanic male wage earners uniquely have experienced a decline in offer rates foremployment-based coverage.

There is little about\nthe distinctive experiences of American Indians and Alaska Natives in the litera-\nture discussing insurance status and the uninsured population. There are few\npublished population-level studies, and the survey data on which these studies are\nbased may be weakened by small sample size since there are only 2.4 million self-\nidentified American Indians and Alaska Natives (roughly 1 percent of the U.S.\npopulation); by inconsistencies in identifying and coding ethnic identity; and by a\nwide geographic range of residence (Brown et al., 2000a). It is important to note\nthat in addition to or instead of insurance, some receive services directly through\nthe Indian Health Service.\nThis high uninsured rate for Native Americans reflects a lower rate of em-\nployment-based coverage, higher-than-average unemployment rates, and lower-\nthan-average wages for those who are employed. These three factors are only\npartially offset by a higher-than-average rate of public coverage by Medicaid and\nSCHIP. The federal Indian Health Service (IHS) delivers health care directly to\npersons who are recognized as American Indians or Alaska Natives. These services\nreach only about 20 percent of this population, mainly persons who live on\nreservations, who reside near the few urban IHS facilities around the country, and\nwho belong to tribes that are federally recognized. The relatively low proportion\nof persons who obtain services from IHS reflects in part the predominantly urban\nlocation of this population (Brown et al., 2000a). Among Native Americans, 51\npercent have employment-based coverage, compared with 73 percent of non-\nHispanic whites, and individual insurance coverage is at one-fifth the rate of that\nfor non-Hispanic whites (Brown et al., 2000a). About 17 percent of Native\nAmericans have Medicaid, almost three times the rate of non-Hispanic whites (6\npercent), reflecting the fact that Native Americans are about twice as likely to be\nmembers of lower-income families (Brown et al., 2000a).

When a family\u2019s primary wage earner has obtained\nemployment-based coverage, the employment-based coverage rate for dependents\nis lower for African-American family members than for Hispanics (34 percent\nversus 43 percent, respectively) and the public coverage rate is higher (9 percent\nversus 5 percent) (Custer and Ketsche, 2000b). A lower proportion of African-\nAmerican families have at least one full-time, full-year wage earner (58 percent,\ncompared with 71 percent for non-Hispanic whites). Across all firm sizes, African\nAmericans have lower employment-based coverage rates than non-Hispanic\nwhites, with the disparity ranging from 14 to 30 percentage points (Brown et al.,\n2000a).\nAcross employment sectors, African Americans have lower employment-\nbased coverage rates than non-Hispanic whites. For sectors with lower coverage\nsuch as agriculture and sales, 45 percent of African Americans are covered com-\npared with 66 percent of non-Hispanic whites. For higher-coverage sectors such\nas manufacturing and professional services, 72 percent of African Americans are\ncovered, compared with 86 percent of non-Hispanic whites (Brown et al., 2000a).\nOver time, African-American men have had a declining take-up rate for employ-\nment-based coverage, in comparison to non-Hispanic whites (Cunningham,\n1999a;  Custer and Ketsche, 2000b).

Gener-\nally, for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders the rates of public insurance (Med-\nicaid) are lower than those for other racial and ethnic groups, except for Southeast\nAsians, whose refugee status allows them to obtain public insurance coverage\n(Brown et al., 2000a).\nGender\nMore men than women are uninsured, and men are more likely than\nwomen to be uninsured.\nGender disparities in insurance coverage reflect the different experiences of\nmen and women in the workplace and with public policies. There are more\nuninsured men (ages 18 through 64 years) than women, although women have a\nlower rate of employment-based coverage (Fronstin, 2000d). More women, on\naverage, are eligible for public insurance because of their lower average income\nlevel and the greater likelihood that they may qualify for Medicaid during preg-\nnancy or as the parent of infants and young children (Short, 1998). Most adults\nwith Medicaid are women in lower-income families, for the most part pregnant\nwomen or the mothers of young children (Wyn et al., 2001). While fewer women\nthan men go without coverage entirely, the greater number of women with\nindividual insurance coverage and the higher number of women covered by\npublic insurance are cause for concern, because such coverage tends to be un-\nstable, thus creating more opportunities for gaps in coverage. (Miles and Parker,\n1997; Fronstin, 2000d).\nBoth income and marital status are important influences on the likelihood\nthat wage-earning women will be uninsured (Buchmueller, 1996\u20131997; Short,\n1998). Single women are more likely to be offered employment-based health\ninsurance than are single men (an offer rate of 78 compared to 72 percent),\nwhereas married women are somewhat less likely than married men to be offered\nemployment-based coverage. Lower take-up rates among married women wage\nearners, compared to married male wage earners (63 percent versus 72 percent) are\na consequence of the greater likelihood that married women are insured as depen-\ndents on their spouse\u2019s health insurance policy (Buchmueller, 1996\u20131997, based\non 1993 Current Population Survey data).\nCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Differences among states with respect to population characteristics,\nindustrial economic base, eligibility for public insurance, and relative purchasing\npower of family incomes shape the geographic disparities in insurance coverage\nrates (Marsteller et al., 1998; Rowland et al., 1998; Brown et al., 2000b;\nCunningham and Ginsburg, 2001).\nRegion and State\nThe South and the West, the most populous regions, are home to\nthe greatest numbers of uninsured persons (an estimated 17 million and\n12 million, respectively). Residents of these regions are more likely than\naverage to be uninsured.\nThe pattern is similar for persons at all income levels: Southerners and West-\nerners are more likely to be uninsured than are those who live in the North and\nMidwest (Figures 3.23, 3.24, and 3.25) (Fronstin, 2000d; Mills, 2000).

Although uninsured resi-\ndents of rural areas are fewer in number, their presence is no less a concern. Similar\nto the overall trend in the 1990s, the number and proportion of uninsured among\nrural residents has increased (Pol, 2000).\nRural and urban areas differ in the mix of sources of coverage for their\nresidents, with a higher private coverage rate in urban (71 percent) than in rural\n(68 percent) areas and a higher public coverage rate in rural areas (14 percent)\ncompared to urban (11 percent) areas (Rhoades and Chu, 2000). The difficulties\nthat small businesses face in purchasing affordable health insurance policies for\ntheir employees account for much of the disparity in coverage between rural and\nurban wage earners (Coburn et al., 1998;  Mueller et al., 1998; Pol, 2000). In\naddition, rural uninsured workers are more likely to be employed by lower-waged\nfirms, to work on a contingent basis, and to work in particular employment sectors\n(e.g., agriculture) with lower-than-average coverage rates. Even though there are\ngreater numbers of lower-income uninsured persons among urban than among\nrural residents, rural uninsured workers are even more likely than their urban\ncounterparts to earn relatively lower wages and to be members of lower-income\nfamilies.\nFor urban areas, uninsured rates vary not only with differing population\ndensities but also with the socioeconomic status of residents and with the presence\nof sizable immigrant communities (Brown et al., 2000b).

More than 40 percent of the difference in unin-\nsured rates between families with primary wage earners who have not graduated\nfrom high school and families whose primary wage earners have post-college\neducation would be eliminated if these families resembled one another demo-\ngraphically, geographically, and in terms of health status.\n13\nImmigrant and nativity status have a pronounced  influence on differences in\nuninsured rates among groups. Nearly 60 percent of the difference between\nuninsured rates for U.S.-born residents and naturalized citizens would disappear if\nnaturalized citizens as a group shared the socioeconomic, demographic, health\nstatus, and geographic distribution characteristics of the U.S.-born population.\n14\nDifferences between uninsured rates diminish when multivariate analysis is used to\ncompare the population of long-term residents who are not citizens with persons\nborn in the United States (a 26 percent decrease) and between short-term residents\nwho are not citizens and U.S.-born residents (a 50 percent decrease).\nRace and ethnicity play a significant role, both independently and together\nwith immigrant and nativity status. If non-Hispanic African Americans as a group\nhad the same measured characteristics as non-Hispanic whites, the difference\nbetween the uninsured rates for the two groups would decrease by roughly half.\n15\nWhen immigrant status is considered in addition to race and ethnicity, the size of\nthese differences among the groups diminishes but remains significant. Differences\nin state uninsured rates shrink considerably if variations in the socioeconomic,\ndemographic, and health status characteristics within each state\u2019s population are\ntaken into account.\n16 Given the limits of any statistical model, one would not\nexpect differences among the states\u2019 uninsured rates to disappear completely.

Three-quarters of the uninsured are adults between\nthe ages of 18 and 64, with one-half between the ages of 18 and 34 and one-\nquarter under the age of 18. Almost 80 percent are U.S.-born citizens, and half are\nnon-Hispanic whites. Most are residents of the South and West, and three-\nquarters live in urban areas.\nWho Is Most Likely to Go Without Coverage?\nIn bivariate analyses, a highly correlated set of socioeconomic factors exerts a\nkey influence on the probability that a person will be uninsured. These factors\ninclude work status, family income, educational attainment, selected characteris-\ntics of a primary wage-earner\u2019s employer, and the age of a family\u2019s primary wage\nearner. Marital status and the presence of children each affect the potential oppor-\ntunities for family members to obtain coverage. Coverage disparities for immi-\ngrants, for members of racial and ethnic minority groups, and to a lesser extent, for\nadult women, all reflect the importance of socioeconomic status, as well as the\nsupporting roles played by public policies at the federal, state, and local levels. In\naddition, uninsured rates vary regionally and across the states. The presence of\ncomparable uninsured rates between urban and rural areas can mask important\ndifferences in sources of coverage for rural and urban residents. In addition, a\nlower-income urban resident\u2019s chances of obtaining coverage decline if he or she\nlives in a city with a higher-than-average uninsured rate rather than in a city with\na lower-than-average uninsured rate.\nSocioeconomic, demographic, and geographic characteristics all have signifi-\ncant independent effects on the likelihood that one person will be uninsured\ncompared to another. Differences in income, occupation, employment sector and\nfirm size, education, health status, age, gender, race and ethnicity, citizenship\nstatus and length of residency, and geography account for much of the variability\namong people in their likelihood of being uninsured.

Health Outcomes of People Who Lack Health\nInsurance\nAs already established by more than three decades of health services research,\ninsurance coverage facilitates access to health care.

They are also likely to receive fewer services\nwhen they do seek care (Newhouse et al., 1993).

This study reports that adults who were  uninsured for\na year or longer were substantially less likely than those with coverage or those\nwho were uninsured for shorter times to be screened for cancers, to receive\nservices that reduce cardiovascular risks (e.g., hypertension, cholesterol screening\nand counseling about weight and smoking), and to receive regular care for diabe-\ntes, including foot and eye exams. These specific services are associated with\nimproved longer-term health outcomes (Institute of Medicine, 2001).\nLongitudinal studies following the same individuals over time can provide\neven more definitive evidence of the health effects of being uninsured, because\nunexamined characteristics of the study population are less likely to account for\ndifferences in outcomes between those with and those without insurance. In a\nstudy that followed a cohort of adult Medi-Cal beneficiaries who lost coverage in\nthe mid-1980s, Lurie and colleagues found that both six months and one year after\nlosing coverage, these persons reported poorer overall health and were less likely\nto have a usual source of care or believe that they could obtain care if needed than\nthey had reported when participating in Medi-Cal. Former enrollees with hyper-\ntension had worse blood pressure control both at six months and one year than\nthey had while enrolled in Medi-Cal (Lurie et al. 1984, 1986).\nThese are just two of literally hundreds of studies that have taken health\ninsurance status into account as a characteristic that might affect a health outcome\nof some kind.  Not all such studies have found a relationship between health\ninsurance and health outcomes, and not all such studies are methodologically\nsound. The second report will present and use explicit criteria to assess evidence of\nthe impact of health insurance status on individual adult health outcomes.

Furthermore, if the health of unin-\nsured adults suffers as a result of impeded access to care, their ability to care for\ntheir children may also be adversely affected. Finally, when one or more family\nmember lacks coverage for health care, the entire family is exposed to potentially\ncatastrophic financial costs. Even when confronted with less catastrophic illness,\nuninsured families are significantly more likely to have high out-of-pocket medi-\ncal expenses than are privately insured or Medicaid-enrolled families, although\nprivately insured families are likely to pay more in health insurance premiums\n(Davidoff et al., 2000).\nThe Committee will review and document the effects on families when one\nor more members lack health insurance.

Faced with a need\nfor health care, some people without health insurance seek the care they need and\npay for it out-of-pocket, some try to obtain the care at subsidized rates or at public\nexpense, and some forgo care. The result for the individual is often poorer than\nthat obtained by people with insurance coverage.

Thus, one set of community\nimpacts may include higher prices, higher taxes, or dependence on philanthropy\nto support care for persons without health insurance.\nOther community consequences result from the financial burden placed on\nproviders who treat large numbers of uninsured patients. These effects may in-\nclude cutbacks in service, closure or relocation of services, overcrowded emer-\ngency rooms, and relocation of physicians\u2019 offices or even hospitals from areas of\ntown that have concentrations of uninsured persons. These disruptions may re-\nduce people\u2019s access to care regardless of their insurance status. A third potential\nimpact of uninsured populations on communities follows from the failure to\nobtain needed health care for communicable diseases, such as treatment for tuber-\nculosis or diagnosis of HIV infection. Although these effects have not been well\ndocumented by published research, the Committee intends to investigate available\nsources of information to examine whether there are public costs related to pre-\nventable disability and an increased incidence of communicable diseases related to\nuninsured populations.\nThe report will identify the nature and magnitude of effects on geographically\ndefined communities in which differing proportions of the population lack health\ninsurance with a focus on communities (municipalities, metropolitan areas, rural\nareas, states) that have disproportionately large uninsured populations.

This three-part framework is based on an\neconomic model of insurance status and the impact of out-of-pocket costs on\nhealth care demand. Both have been linked to Andersen\u2019s model of access to\nhealth services, which incorporates ideas from the behavioral sciences to under-\nstand the processes of health services delivery and health-related outcomes for\nindividuals (Andersen and Davidson, 2001).\nThe framework uses the Andersen model\u2019s grouping of variables into three\ncategories:  (1)  resources that foster or enable the process of obtaining health care;\n(2) personal or community characteristics that favor or predispose action related to\nobtaining health care; and (3)  needs for health care, as articulated by those in\nneed, determined by health care providers, or identified by researchers and deci-\nsion makers. Arrows and spatial relationships among the boxes indicate hypoth-\nesized causal and temporal relationships. For example, a woman might have insur-\nance coverage for a mammography screening, but if she has no regular source of\ncare and lives 20 miles from the nearest facility offering such service, she could face\nobstacles to obtaining care. This case can be followed through the model, as\nshown below.\nFor the purposes of this study, the Committee linked Andersen\u2019s model to\ndeterminants of health insurance status. These changes to the model allow one to\ncharacterize not only individual-  and population-level health indicators, but also\neconomic measures of family well-being, institutional viability, and community-\nlevel socioeconomic conditions.

In the example,\nthe woman\u2019s eligibility for coverage of mammography screening would be an\nindividual determinant of coverage, the top box in Panel 1. In the model, com-\nmunity-level factors include public program eligibility standards, labor market\ncharacteristics that determine the availability of employment-based health insur-\nance, and the commercial market for individual health insurance. This is a con-\ndensed version of the detailed figure on determinants of eligibility and enrollment\n(Figure 2.2), and the logic laid out in Chapter 2.\nPANEL 2: PROCESS OF OBTAINING ACCESS TO\nHEALTH SERVICES\nThe center third of Figure A.1 is based on Andersen\u2019s model of\naccess to health care (Andersen and Davidson, 2001). The boxes labeled \u201ccommu-\nnity level\u201d and \u201cindividual and family level\u201d each contain aggregate and indi-\nvidual-level variables, respectively, believed to influence how people obtain access\nto health care. Community-level variables describe the context or environment\nwithin which individuals and their families seek and use health care. Because\nhealth care services are provided and consumed locally, the term \u201ccommunity\u201d\nrefers to a residential or geographic grouping. The woman discussed earlier lived\n20 miles from a mammography site, a factor that would be included in the lower\nleft box of Panel 2.\nImplicit in grouping variables into the categories of resources, characteristics,\nand needs are judgments about how much a particular variable may be susceptible\nto change. Variables labeled as \u201cresources\u201d are considered, at least theoretically, to\nbe more open to change. Those termed \u201ccharacteristics\u201d are considered less flex-\nible or manipulable, and those called \u201cneeds\u201d comprise a mixed or heterogeneous\ngrouping, with some needs being more changeable than others.\nAs a whole, community-level and individual- and family-level variables de-\nscribe many potential scenarios for accessing health care. The variables within the\nbox labeled \u201chealth care\u201d describe how these potentials may be realized, with\nparticular attention to the role of health insurance coverage. The process of health\ncare delivery is characterized in terms of three types of variables: (1) personal\nhealth practices (e.g., dietary habits, physical exercise), (2) the use of health ser-\nvices (e.g., number and kind of physician visits within a year), and (3) processes of", "summary": "Figure A.1 addresses the key determinants that influence the coverage status of individuals and families.

These effects of realized access to\nhealth care cascade from the smallest unit of analysis, the individual, to increasingly\nlarger units, first that of the family and then the community. The consequences\nlinked to health insurance influence community-level and individual- and family-\nlevel variables that describe the process of obtaining access to health care and also\nof gaining or losing health insurance coverage. The process is dynamic with\nmultiple feedbacks. Employment status and income influence insurance status,\nwhich affects current and future health status. This in turn can influence employ-\nment status, bringing us full circle. The woman discussed in the example might\nhave a malignant lump that goes undetected because the obstacles mentioned\nabove deter her from seeking a screening mammogram. She could undergo more\nextensive surgery and related treatments than would have been necessary if the\nlump had been detected earlier. This would be a negative health outcome (the top\nbox in Panel 3) that might affect her family in serious ways (middle box of Panel\n3) and might also affect her eligibility for health insurance in the future (back to\nPanel 1, top box).\nThis conceptual framework provides a basis for discussing many variables\nrelated to health insurance coverage in this report. It will also serve to guide\nanalyses for the Committee\u2019s future reports.

Until the March 2000 survey, the CPS did  not\nask individuals directly if they were uninsured. Instead, it asked about a series of\ncoverage types such as private insurance and Medicare. Those individuals who did\nnot acknowledge any form of coverage were counted as uninsured.\nIn the March 2000 CPS an experimental question was added to the interview\nto verify whether a person was uninsured throughout the previous year. While the\nresults from the experimental questions were not known when this report went to\npress, it is likely that the Census will revise its uninsured estimate downward,\nmaking the CPS estimates more consistent with other surveys such as the Com-\nmunity Tracking Survey and the National Survey of American Families that do\nuse a verification question.\nIssues that arise in the CPS include the following:\n\u2022 Recall period. The CPS asks if someone was covered by a particular form of\nhealth insurance at any time over the previous year. It appears that respondents\nanswer the question in different ways. Some may report coverage status at the time\nof the interview, rather than over the previous calendar year. Some may not\naccurately recall when coverage began or ended and thus fail to report coverage\nduring the period in question (Lewis et al., 1998.)\n\u2022 Household and family definition. The CPS defines households as all persons\nunder a roof and family members as all related persons in a household. A family\nunit for health insurance purposes tends to consist of fewer persons than all who\nlive in a household.  For example, a single parent and children may live with the\nchild\u2019s grandparents, but the grandchildren would be unlikely to be eligible for\nhealth insurance coverage through their grandparents\u2019 employers.\n\u2022 Underreporting participation in public programs.  Although the CPS uses state\nprogram names when asking about Medicaid, and thus refers to Medi-Cal in\nCalifornia and MediPass in Florida, CPS data show fewer people participating in\nMedicaid than do administrative records for the program.\nCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

But, of course, you can\u2019t all visit our offices to see our health policy history wall\u2014and many of \nyou may have quibbles if you did.\nFor us at KFF, our definition efle ts our views and what we do: Health policy centers around, well \npolicy\u2014what the government does, and public programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the ACA, and \nheavily emphasizes financing and overage.\nWe also focus relentlessly on people, not health professionals and health care institutions (I have never \nbeen fond of the word \u201cprovider\u201d). Others have a more expansive definition and tht\u2019s fine. Wh t I \nultimately settled on doing is far simpler: Organizing the basic materials we have on the issues we work on, \nrecognizing that they do not represent every topic of interest to the faculty and students we hope to assist.\nThe result is the following chapters. We will add chapters over time as we develop them. Our \norganization changes to play our role as an independent source of analysis, polling, and journalism on \nnational health issues, and as that happens, we will add more content on subjects not covered in this \nfi st installment. We will also add chapters as we get feedback from you. And we will update the \u201c101\u201d at \nleast annually as data and circumstances change.\nLet me know if this is helpful and how it can be improved.

This coverage system has evolved over the years, most recently with the \nimplementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which aimed to reduce the uninsured rate by expanding \nMedicaid, creating health insurance Marketplaces for individuals, and providing subsidies to make the coverage \nmore affordable. Many factors, including economic conditions, federal and state policy changes, and significant \nhealth crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, influence the uninsured rate. The ACA and recent policy changes \ndesigned to protect coverage during the pandemic have led to  increased health coverage overall; however, \nlongstanding racial and ethnic disparities in coverage persist. \nWhat is the Landscape of Health Care Coverage in the \nUnited States? \nHealth coverage in the U.S. is a complex patchwork of private and public insurance coverage options. In 2022, \nmost residents had private insurance coverage, with nearly half covered by an employer-based plan. About 1 in \n5 U.S. residents received coverage through the Medicaid program, the federal and state-financed \ncomprehensive health coverage program for low-income people. Another roughly 15% of the population had \nhealth coverage from the federal Medicare program, which covers seniors and people under age 65 with long-\nterm disabilities. About 6% of the population had private non-group insurance either purchased through the \nACA Marketplace or off-market, and just over 1% of the population was covered through the military\u2019s Tricare \nprogram. The uninsured rate for the total population was 8.0% for the year (Figure 1). (In some cases, people \nhave multiple forms of coverage. For example, about 13 million people are enrolled in both Medicare and \nMedicaid and are classified in these figures as covered by Medicaid.)", "summary": "Health coverage in the U.S. is marked by a blend of private and public insurance options that leaves about 8% of the population uninsured.

Generally favorable economic conditions as well as policy changes during \nthe Trump Administration, such as reduced funding for outreach and enrollment assistance, encouraging \nperiodic Medicaid eligibility checks, changes to immigration policy related to public charge rules, and approval \nof some demonstration waivers to restrict enrollment led to a decline in Medicaid enrollment, which likely \ncontributed to the increase in uninsured people.   \nWith the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, policies adopted to protect coverage drove a decline in the \nuninsured population from 2019 to 2022. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act required states to keep \npeople continuously enrolled in Medicaid in exchange for enhanced federal funding. (Medicaid continuous \nenrollment ended in March 2023.) In addition, the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) provided temporary \nenhanced ACA Marketplace subsidies to make Marketplace coverage more affordable, and these subsidies were \nrenewed for another three years in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 . \nWho is Uninsured in the United States? \nMost people who are uninsured are nonelderly adults, in working low -income families, are people of color, and, \nreflecting geographic variation in income, immigration status, and the availability of public coverage, live in the \nSouth or West. In 2022, over 7 in 10 people who were uninsured were nonelderly adults and just over a quarter \nwere children.  \nNearly three-quarters (73.3%) of the nonelderly uninsured population had at least one full-time worker in their \nfamily and an additional 10.9% had a part-time worker in their family (Figure 4). More than 8 in 10 (80.8%) \npeople who were uninsured were in families with incomes below 400% FPL in 2022 and nearly half (46.6%) had \nincomes below 200% FPL. People of color comprised over 62% of the nonelderly uninsured population in 2022 \ndespite making up about 46% of nonelderly residents. Most uninsured individuals (75.6%) were U.S. citizens, \nwhile 24.4% were noncitizens in 2022. Nearly three-quarters lived in the South and West.", "summary": "After declining through 2016, the number of uninsured people and the uninsured rate began increasing in 2017 and continued to grow through 2019.

In 2022, 60.7% of nonelderly uninsured workers \nworked for an employer that did not offer them health benefits. Among uninsured workers who are offered \ncoverage by their employers, cost is often a barrier to taking up the offer. Low -income families with employer-\nbased coverage spend a significantly higher share of their income toward premiums and out -of-pocket medical \nexpenses compared to those with income above 200% FPL.  \nA decade after the implementation of the ACA coverage options, 10 states have not adopted the Medicaid \nexpansion, leaving 1.5 million uninsured people without an affordable coverage option.  A coverage gap exists in \nstates that have not adopted the expansion for poor adults who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid coverage \nbut not enough to be eligible for subsidies in the Marketplace. \nLawfully present immigrants generally must meet a five-year waiting period after receiving qualified \nimmigration status before they can qualify for Medicaid. States have the option to cover eligible children and \npregnant people without a waiting period, and as of January 2023, 35 states have elected the option for children \nand 26 states have taken up the option for lawfully present pregnant individuals. Lawfully present immigrants \nare eligible for Marketplace tax credits, including those who are not eligible for Medicaid because they have  not \nmet the five-year waiting period. However, the fear of the federal rules about \u201cpublic charge,\u201d which can deny an \nindividual entry to the U.S. or adjustment to lawful permanent status (a green card) if it is determined the \nindividual has a likelihood of becoming primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, can deter \nimmigrants from seeking coverage. Undocumented immigrants are ineligible for federally -funded coverage, \nincluding Medicaid and Marketplace coverage.  \nThough financial assistance is available to many of the remaining uninsured under the ACA, not everyone who is \nuninsured is eligible for free or subsidized coverage. Six in 10 (15.3 million) uninsured individuals in 2022 were \neligible for financial assistance through Medicaid or subsidized Marketplace coverage (Figure 8).

In \naddition, we seek comments on the amount of the CMP imposed per day up to the statutory \nmaximum daily amount that would be applicable to all noncompliant providers.  \nc.  Appeals Process \nWe believe it is important to establish a fair administrative process by which providers \nmay appeal CMS\u2019 decisions to impose penalties under the requirements established by \u00a7 182.40.  \nThrough various programs, we have gained experience with administrative hearings and other \nprocesses to review CMS\u2019 determinations.  That experience includes the processes we recently \nfinalized in the CY 2020 Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) Price \nTransparency Final Rule (84 FR 65524) and corresponding regulations at 45 CFR part 180, \nwhich requires price transparency for hospitals, and we are aligning the procedures for the \nappeals process here with those procedures.  Therefore, a provider upon which CMS has \nimposed a penalty under \u00a7 182.70 may appeal that penalty in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 180.100 and \n180.110, subpart D, with conforming edits.", "summary": "CMS will issue a written demand for payment no later than 30 days after a debt is delinquent.

A \nprovider against which a final order imposing a CMP is entered may obtain judicial review. \nWe specify at \u00a7 182.80 the procedures for a provider to appeal the CMP imposed by \nCMS for its noncompliance with the requirements of \u00a7 182.40 to an ALJ, and for the CMS \nAdministrator, at his or her discretion, to review in whole or in part the ALJ\u2019s decision.

If the 30th calendar day is a weekend or a Federal holiday, \nthen the timeframe is extended until the end of the next business day.
