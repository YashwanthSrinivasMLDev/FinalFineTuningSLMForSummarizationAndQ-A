[{"article": "1 \n  \nCounty Data for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services \n(CLAS County Data) \nEdition Date: November 2023 \nPublic Health Service (PHS) Act section 2719 and its implementing regulations require non-\ngrandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered \nhealth insurance coverage to provide relevant notices in a culturally and linguistically \nappropriate manner. The regulations implementing section 2719 require these plans and issuers \nto make certain accommodations for notices sent to an address in a county meeting a threshold \npercentage of people who are literate only in the same non-English language. This threshold \npercentage is set at 10 percent or more of the population residing in the claimant\u2019s county, as \ndetermined based on American Community Survey (ACS) data published by the United States \nCensus Bureau.\n12 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-2719(e), 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2590.715-2719(e), and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n147.136(e). \n1 The Final Rules for Grandfathered Plans, Preexisting Condition Exclusions, Lifetime and Annual Limits, \nRe\nscissions, Dependent Coverage, Appeals, and Patient Protections Under the Affordable Care Act establish that the \nthreshold percentage of people who are literate only in the same non-English language must be determined based on \nACS data published by the U.S. Census Bureau, 80 FR 72192, 72208 (Nov. 18, 2015), available at \nht\ntps://www.federalregister.gov/d/2015-29294/p-185. \n2 The relevant ACS data set used is the U.S. Census, 2016-20 20 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, \nTable B16001, Language Spoken at Home by Ability to Speak English for the Population 5 Years and Over, \navailable at ht\ntps://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?tid=ACSDT5Y2020.B16001. The Departments note that this \nguidance is also applicable to group health plans, including non-F ederal governmental plans, (whether insured or \nself-insured) offering coverage in the U.S. Territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, \nPuerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and that are subject to the language access standards in PHS Act section \n2719. However, HHS determined that certain PHS Act requirements enacted in the Affordable Care Act are \nappropriately governed by the definition of \"state\u201d at ACA section 1304(d) and therefore will not apply to health \ninsurance issuers in the U.S. Territories. See the 2016 Payment Notice final rule, 80 FR at 10757, 10781, 10862, and \n10863 (amending the definition of \u201cState\u201d in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 144.103 and 154.102).\u201d This analysis applies only to \nhealth insurance governed by the PHS Act.

The Departments specify in the \npreamble to the TiC Final Rules that the In-network Rate File requirement applies to plans and \nissuers regardless of the type of payment model or models under which they provide coverage.\n4 \n                                               \n1 26 CFR 54.9815-2715A3; 29 CFR\u20092590.715-2715A3; and 45 CFR 147.212; 85 FR 72158 (Nov. 12, 2020).", "summary": " The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way .

The TiC Final Rules do not require plans or issuers to develop a \nnew methodology for providing derived amounts. If the plan or issuer uses underlying fee \nschedule rates for calculating cost sharing, the plan or issuer should include the underlying fee \nschedule rates in addition to the negotiated rates or derived amounts. \n \nNotably, the TiC Final Rules require that these rates be reflected in the In-network Rate File as \ndollar amounts. While there are many alternative reimbursement arrangements that do not have a \ndollar amount associated with particular items and services before the item or service is provided \nor rendered, a dollar amount can still be determined in some instances under these models. \nAccordingly, in the preamble to the TiC Final Rules, the Departments provide a list of alternative \nreimbursement arrangements and summarize general reporting expectations for these models, \nwhile acknowledging that this list is not exhaustive, as there may be other alternative \nreimbursement or contracting arrangements in use.\n5 Specifically, the Departments summarize the \ngeneral reporting expectations for several alternative reimbursement arrangements, including \nbundled payment arrangements and capitation arrangements (including sole capitation \narrangements and partial capitation arrangements), reference-based pricing without a defined \nnetwork, reference-based pricing with a defined network, and value-based purchasing.

Provisions of the Interim Final Rule with Comment Period (IFC) \nIn this IFC, we use the term, \u201cPublic Health Emergency (PHE),\u201d as defined at 42 CFR \n400.200. The definition identifies the PHE determined to exist nationwide by the Secretary under \nsection 319 of the PHSA on January 31, 2020, and renewed effective July 25, 2020,6 as a result \nof confirmed cases of COVID-19.   \nA.  New Enforcement Requirement for LTC Facilities \nUnder sections 1866 and 1902 of the Social Security Act (the Act), providers of services \nseeking to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid program, or both, must enter into an \nagreement with the Secretary or the state Medicaid agency, as appropriate.  LTC facilities \nseeking to be Medicare and Medicaid providers of services must be certified as meeting federal \nparticipation requirements.  LTC facilities include SNFs for Medicare and nursing facilities \n(NFs) for Medicaid. The federal participation requirements for these facilities are specified in \nsections 1819 and 1919 of the Act and in implementing regulations at 42 CFR part 483, subpart \nB.  \nUnder sections 1819(f)(1) and 1919(f)(1) of the Act, the Secretary must assure that the \nenforcement of compliance with the participation requirements are adequate to protect the health, \nsafety, welfare, and rights of residents and to promote the effective use of public moneys. The \nfederal requirements related to enforcement of the requirements for SNFs, NFs, or dually-\ncertified facilities, are set forth in sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act and codified in the \nregulations at 42 CFR part 488, subpart F. Among the remedies available to be imposed for \nnoncompliance with the requirements is a civil money penalty (CMP), as authorized in sections \n1819(h)(2)(B)(ii) and 1919(h)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, and \u00a7\u00a7 488.430 through 488.444.   \n \n6 https://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx.", "summary": " New Enforcement Requirement for LTC Facilities includes SNFs for Medicare and nursing facilities for Medicaid .

This new regulation requires nursing \nhomes to report COVID-19 related facility data to the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network \n(NHSN).  These new CMS reporting requirements do not preclude a facility from following all \nstate and local public health reporting laws and regulations. \nSpecifically, we revised our requirements by adding new provisions at \u00a7\u00a7 483.80(g)(1) \nand (2), to require facilities to electronically report information about COVID-19 in a \nstandardized format and at a frequency specified by the Secretary, but not less than weekly to the \nCDC NHSN. This critical information will provide real-time information on COVID-19 in \nnursing homes, and will be used to monitor trends in infection rates, and inform public health \npolicies.

We will determine if noncompliance exists through a \nretrospective review each week to identify the facilities that failed to take the necessary and \ntimely actions to report to CDC.  Noncompliance with this requirement for each weekly \nreporting cycle will be cited at a scope of widespread, and a severity of no actual harm with \npotential for more than minimal harm that is not immediate jeopardy, which constitutes a level \n\u201cF\u201d deficiency.  This is consistent with guidance that was issued in QSO 20-29-NH7 which also \nincluded enforcement policies for the imposition of a CMP for the failure to report to the CDC \nNHSN.   \nWith this IFC, we are furthering enforcement efforts of the recently issued requirements \nat \u00a7 483.80(g)(1) and (2) that facilities report COVID-19 related information to the CDC\u2019s \nNHSN by making revisions to part 488.  These revisions codify enforcement policies that are \nspecifically tailored to reviewing compliance with and imposing CMPs for the failure to report.  \nWe are enforcing the new reporting requirements through the imposition of CMPs for each time \na facility fails to report the required data to the CDC NHSN system.  We believe that CMPs are \nan appropriate enforcement remedy that will facilitate a swift return to compliance with the new \nreporting requirement. Sections 1819(h)(2)(B)(ii)(I) and 1919(h)(3)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act limit the \namount of a CMP to $10,0008 for each day of noncompliance.  We have determined that a \nminimum $1,000 initial CMP, with a $500 incremental increase, is within the authorized CMP \nrange and an appropriate amount to deter noncompliance with this requirement.

For each subsequent time the facility fails to report the requisite COVID-\n19 related data, the amount of the CMP imposed will be increased by $500, which is consistent \nwith sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and 1919(h)(3)(C) of the Act providing for the imposition of \nincrementally more severe fines for repeated deficiencies.  For example, if a facility fails to \nreport in 1 week, a minimum $1,000 CMP will be imposed for that occurrence of \nnoncompliance.  If it fails to report again in the subsequent week that new noncompliance \ndetermination will lead to the imposition of another CMP but in the increased amount of $1,500 \nfor that failure to report.

Waiving notice and comment is in the public interest because the \nheightened threat to resident health and safety for, widespread infection control noncompliance \nnecessitates the expedited imposition of enforcement remedies.  Additionally, because it is \nimperative to track the incidence and impact of COVID-19 in nursing homes, it is crucial that a \nfinancial penalty be imposed for failure to report. The CMP amounts we codify in this IFC will \nhelp deter noncompliance and encourage facilities to establish procedures that result in prompt \nweekly COVID-19 related data reports for the duration of the PHE for COVID-19.

Requirements for Laboratories to Report SARS-CoV-2 Test Results During the PHE for \nCOVID-19  \nAssuring a rapid and thorough public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic relies \non having complete and comprehensive laboratory testing data, including standardized test \nresults, relevant demographic details, and additional information that can improve both the \nresponse to SARS-CoV-2 and treatment of COVID-19.  These data can contribute to \nunderstanding disease incidence and trends: initiating epidemiologic case investigations, \nassisting with contact tracing, assessing availability and use of testing resources, and identifying \nsupply chain issues for reagents and other material.  Laboratory testing data, in conjunction with \ncase reports and other data, also provide vital guidance for mitigation and control activities. \nSection 18115(a) of the CARES Act requires every laboratory that performs or analyzes a \ntest that is intended to detect SARS- CoV-2 or to diagnose a possible case of COVID-\n19(hereinafter referred to as a \u201cSARS-CoV-2 test\u201d or \u201cCOVID-19 diagnostic test\u201d) to report the \nresults from each such test to the Secretary until the end of the  PHE for COVID\u201319.  In addition, \nthe statute authorizes the Secretary to prescribe the form and manner, and timing and frequency, \nof such reporting.  As indicated in HHS guidance issued on June 4, 2020,11 in an effort to receive \nthese data in the most efficient and effective manner, the Secretary has required that all data be \nreported through existing public health data reporting methods.

L. 100-578) (codified as \namended at 42 U.S.C. 263a) requiring any laboratory that examines human specimens for the \npurpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or \nimpairment of, or the assessment of health, of human beings to be certified by the Secretary for \nthe categories of examinations or procedures performed by the laboratory.  The implementing \nregulations at 42 CFR part 493 specify the conditions and standards that must be met to achieve \nand maintain CLIA certification.  These conditions and standards strengthen federal oversight of \nclinical laboratories and help ensure the accuracy and reliability of patient test results. \nCurrently, the CLIA program only collects non-waived testing specialty and subspecialty \ninformation from laboratories issued a Certificate of Compliance (CoC), Certificate of \nAccreditation (CoA), or Certificate of Registration (CoR).

Each of these ECEs relieved these providers and facilities of their \nobligation to report data for the fourth quarter calendar year (CY) 2019, first quarter CY 2020 \nand second quarter CY 2020, but we stated that we would score such data if optionally reported.   \nWe continue to believe that the data we have excepted from mandatory reporting under \nthese ECEs serves multiple purposes, including allowing us to understand the impact of the PHE \nfor COVID-19 on quality of care.

Background of the ESRD QIP ECE Policy \nThe ESRD QIP is authorized under section 1881(h) of the Act, and it aims to promote \nhigh-quality care in dialysis facilities by linking a portion of their payment under the ESRD \nprospective payment system (PPS) directly to their performance on quality of care measures.  \nThe ESRD QIP assesses facility performance on clinical and reporting measures adopted through \nthe rulemaking process and scores dialysis facilities based on that performance.

Unauthorized \ndisclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. \nIn the CY 2015 ESRD PPS final rule (79 FR 66189 through 66190), we adopted an ECE \npolicy for the ESRD QIP, which recognized that there are times when facilities are unable to \nsubmit required quality data due to extraordinary circumstances that are not within their control, \nand that facilities should not be penalized for such circumstances or have their burden unduly \nincrease during these times.  This policy was implemented under the authority of section \n1881(h)(3)(A)(i) of the Act, which requires the Secretary to develop a methodology for assessing \nthe total performance of each provider of services and renal dialysis facility based on \nperformance standards for the measures selected under section 1881(h)(2) of the Act for a \nperformance period established under section 1881(h)(4)(D) of the Act.  We interpreted section \n1881(h)(3)(A)(i) of the Act to enable us to configure the methodology for assessing facilities' \ntotal performance such that we would not require a facility to submit, nor penalize a facility for \nfailing to submit, data on any ESRD QIP quality measure data from any month in which a \nfacility is granted an ECE. \nIn the CY 2018 ESRD PPS final rule (82 FR 50761 through 50763), we modified the \nrequirements for the ESRD QIP\u2019s ECE policy to further align that policy with the ECE policy \nadopted by other quality reporting and VBP programs.  In the CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule (84 \nFR 60714), we codified requirements for the ECE policy at 42 CFR 413.178(d)(3) through (7), \nincluding a new option for facilities to reject an ECE granted by CMS under certain \ncircumstances.

However, we are concerned \nabout the national comparability of these data due to the geographic differences of COVID-19 \nincidence rates and hospitalizations, along with different impacts resulting from different state \nand local law and policy changes implemented in response to COVID-19.  For these reasons, we \nare adopting in this IFC two updates to our current ECE policy for the ESRD QIP.  First, we are \nupdating our regulations at 42 CFR 413.178(d)(7) to state that a facility has opted out of the ECE \nfor COVID-19 with respect to the reporting of fourth quarter 2019 NHSN data if the facility \nactually reported the data by the March 31, 2020 deadline but did not notify CMS that it would \ndo so.

CY 2019 Fourth Quarter NHSN ESRD QIP Measure Data \nAs described previously, we excepted facilities from the requirement to report fourth \nquarter CY 2019 data for the NHSN BSI clinical measure and NHSN Dialysis Event reporting \nmeasure to alleviate the reporting burden on facilities responding to the PHE for COVID-19 that \nwould otherwise be required to report these data by the March 31, 2020 submission deadline.  \nHowever, in both the March 22nd and March 27th guidance we also stated that we would utilize \nthese data if submitted.  At the time we announced the ECE for COVID-19, there were \napproximately 9 days (time period between March 22, 2020 to March 31, 2020) remaining for \nfacilities to submit their fourth quarter 2019 NHSN data, and nearly all facilities (97.6 percent) \ntimely reported fourth quarter 2019 ESRD QIP data on these measures.

Unlike the first and second \nquarter 2020 data, we do not have concerns about the national comparability or \nrepresentativeness of the fourth quarter 2019 NHSN data because those data reflect facility \nperformance prior to the start of the PHE for COVID-19.  In addition, nearly all facilities \nreported these data prior to the announcement of the ECE with the expectation that they would \nbe used for scoring.  Accordingly, we are updating our regulations at \u00a7 413.178(d)(7) to state that \na facility has opted out of the ECE for COVID-19 with respect to the reporting of fourth quarter \n2019 NHSN data if the facility actually reported the data by the March 31, 2020 submission \ndeadline but did not notify CMS that it would do so, and we will include these data when we \ncalculate facility TPSs for PY 2021 and performance standards for PY 2023.  This change will \nenable us to use the data which, as we explain above, are reflective of facility performance and \nwere reported with the expectation that they would be used for scoring.  This change is also \nconsistent with our statement in the ECE announcement that we would score these data if they \nwere submitted.  A facility that did not timely report its fourth quarter 2019 NHSN BSI clinical \nmeasure and NHSN Dialysis Event reporting measure data will not be eligible to receive scores \non those measures for PY 2021.   \nii.  CY 2020 First and Second Quarter ESRD QIP Data \nUnder our current policy, facilities may opt out of the ECE we proactively granted in \nresponse to the PHE for COVID-19, and continue to report ESRD QIP data.  We implemented \nthis policy to give facilities flexibility to continue to report, in particular where a facility does not \nbelieve it has been impacted by the extraordinary circumstance(s).

Furthermore, due to the national nature of this \nPHE for COVID-19, we believe performance scores for certain measures could be biased and not \nreflective of nationally comparable performance.  Similarly, we are concerned that there may be \nindirect and unintended consequences of calculating scores using potentially biased data that \nmay not reflect the facility\u2019s overall quality.  Due to facilities having the option to submit or not \nsubmit data for this period, the data may not provide a nationally comparable assessment of \nperformance. Thus, reporting bias is possible due to the voluntary submission of data; that is, a \nbias could be potentially introduced because only high performers and/or facilities not impacted \nor better resourced would choose to submit data, while impacted facilities and/or facilities with \nfewer resources would choose not to submit data.  This would affect comparisons between \nfacilities with different circumstances, and would not be in keeping with the program goal of \nnational comparison.  Therefore, we believe that it would be inappropriate to include data \nsubmitted regarding care provided during first and second quarter CY 2020 in our calculation of \na facility\u2019s TPS, which is used to determine each facility\u2019s payment adjustment.  Therefore, we \nare revising the opt out policy currently codified at \u00a7 413.178(d)(7) to provide that the opt out \npolicy does not apply to data excepted due to the PHE for COVID-19 with -- that is, the first \nquarter and second quarters of CY 2020 ESRD QIP data.      \nFinally, although the ECE we granted for the ESRD QIP has ended, with data collection \nand reporting requirements having resumed July 1, 2020, we understand that geographic \ndifferences in COVID-19 incidence continue to change during the PHE for COVID-19.

For example, if we granted an ECE that excepted facilities from the \nrequirement to report data for 11 of the 12 months of a given performance period, we would \nconsider not scoring or applying payment adjustments for the associated ESRD QIP payment \nyear because data from the one non-excepted month may not be large enough to calculate \nreliable measure results for scoring purposes.

Updates to the Application of the HAC Reduction Program ECE Policy in Response to the \nPHE for COVID-19  \na.  Background of the HAC Reduction Program ECE Policy \nThe Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program (\u201cHAC Reduction Program\u201d) is \nauthorized under section 1886(p) of the Act and it aims to heighten awareness of HACs and \nreduce the number of incidences that occur through implementing the payment adjustments \nauthorized under such statute.  The HAC Reduction Program began affecting hospitals\u2019 \nMedicare payments with FY 2015 discharges (that is, October 1, 2014).

We noted that we considered the feasibility and \nimplications of excluding data for certain measures for a limited period of time from the \ncalculations of the hospital\u2019s measure results or Total HAC Score for the applicable performance \nperiod.  We expressed our aim to minimize data excluded from the program to allow affected \nhospitals to continue to participate in the HAC Reduction Program for a given year if these \nhospitals continue to meet applicable measure minimum threshold requirements.  We further \nobserved that section 1886(p)(4) of the Act permits the Secretary to determine the applicable \nperiod for HAC data collection, and we interpreted the statute to allow us to determine that the \nperiod not include times when hospitals may encounter extraordinary circumstances.  This policy \nwas similar to the ECE policy for the Hospital Inpatient QRP, as initially adopted in the FY 2012 \nIPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51651), and modified in the FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH PPS final \nrule (78 FR 50836) and the FY 2015 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (79 FR 50277). \nIn the FY 2016 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (80 FR 49580 through 49581), we also stated \nthat this policy would not preclude CMS from granting ECEs to hospitals that do not request \nthem if we determine at our discretion that a disaster or other extraordinary circumstance has \naffected an entire region or locale.  We noted that if CMS makes such a determination to grant an \nECE to hospitals in an affected region or locale, we will convey this decision through routine \ncommunication channels to hospitals, vendors, and QIOs, including, but not limited to, issuing \nmemos, emails, and notices on the QualityNet website.

Background of the HAC Reduction Program ECE Granted for the PHE for COVID-19 \nOn March 22, 2020, in response to COVID-19, we announced relief for clinicians, \nproviders, hospitals, and facilities participating in Medicare QRPs and VBP programs.17  On \nMarch 27, 2020, we published a supplemental guidance memorandum that described in more \ndetail the scope and duration of the ECEs we were granting under each Medicare QRP and VBP \nprogram.18   \nUnder the ECE granted to all eligible hospitals under the HAC Reduction Program, we \nstated that qualifying claims would be excluded from the measure calculations for the CMS \nPatient Safety Indicators (PSI) 90 during the periods January 1, 2020\u2013March 31, 2020 (Q1 2020) \nand April 1, 2020\u2013June 30, 2020 (Q2 2020).  We also provided an exception to reporting for all \nchart-abstracted HAC Reduction Program measures for the May, August, and November 2020 \nsubmission deadlines (for reporting Q4 2019, Q1 2020, and Q2 2020 data, respectively).

Update to the HAC Reduction Program ECE Granted in Response to the PHE for COVID-19 \nWe continue to believe that the HAC Reduction Program data we have excepted serves \nmultiple purposes, including allowing us to understand the impact of the PHE for COVID-19 on \nquality of care.  Furthermore, the chart-abstracted measures in the HAC Reduction Program are \ncalculated based on data submitted to the CDC's NHSN.  We recognize that because the CDC \nuses the same data for epidemiological surveillance, hospitals may have reporting requirements \nwhich are not affected by our ECE (for example, state requirements).  We are also concerned \nwith the national comparability of these data due to the geographic differences of COVID-19 \nincidence rates and hospitalizations along with different impacts resulting from different state \nand local law and policy changes implemented in response to COVID-19.  \nFor data which hospitals optionally report, we believe that the exception granted for those \nprograms with data submission deadlines in April and May 2020 (that is, data from the fourth \nquarter of CY 2019) is distinct from the exceptions granted because data collected may be \ngreatly impacted by the response to COVID-19he (that is, data from the first and second quarters \nof CY 2020).", "summary": " CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 B-F 45: Not releasable to the public UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW:  This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential .

Unauthorized \ndisclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. \ni.  CY 2019 Fourth Quarter Data \nAs described previously, we excepted hospitals from the requirement to report fourth \nquarter CY 2019 data for the HAC Reduction Program to alleviate the reporting burden on \nhospitals that were responding to the PHE for COVID-19 during the May 18, 2020 data \nsubmission deadline.  However, nearly all hospitals (95.3 percent) reported these data by the \nsubmission deadline, which reflects care provided prior to January 27, 2020, which is the start of \nthe PHE for COVID-19 under the Secretary\u2019s declaration of a PHE under section 319 of the \nPHSA.  Therefore, we determined that it would be appropriate to include data that were \noptionally reported by hospitals for the fourth quarter of CY 2019 in calculating hospitals\u2019 Total \nHAC Scores, which are used to determine the worst-performing 25 percent of hospitals on HAC \nperformance for assessing the 1 percent HAC Reduction Program penalty.  This determination is \nconsistent with the policy stated in the March 27, 2020 guidance memo.19  \nii.  CY 2020 First and Second Quarter Data \nIn our application of the ECE policy for the PHE for COVID-19, we excepted hospitals \nfrom the requirement to report first and second quarter of CY 2020 HAC Reduction Program \nchart-abstracted measures and stated we would exclude qualifying claims both because we hoped \nto alleviate the reporting burden on hospitals that were responding to the PHE for COVID-19 \nand because of our concern that the representativeness of the data collected during this period \nmay be greatly impacted by the response to COVID-19.   \nWe also noted that if hospitals optionally chose to report data, we would use that data for \nprogram calculations.  While we continue to encourage optional submission of data, we also aim \n \n19 CMS memorandum available at https://www.cms.gov/files/document/guidance-memo-exceptions-and-extensions-\nquality-reporting-and-value-based-purchasing-programs.pdf.", "summary": " Nearly all hospitals (95.3 percent) reported these data by the deadline, which reflects care provided prior to January 27, 2020, which is the start of the PHE for COVID-19 under the Secretary\u2019s declaration of a PHE under section 319 of the PHSA ."}, {"article": "CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 B-F 47 \n \nINFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: \nThis information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential.

Unauthorized \ndisclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. \nto have the most representative comparison of hospital performance as possible and do not wish \nto unfairly penalize hospitals that were responding to COVID-19.  We believe that using CY \n2020 optionally reported data may not provide a nationally comparable assessment of hospital \nperformance for multiple reasons.  First, allowing hospitals the option to voluntarily submit for \nthis period may introduce reporting bias; that is, a bias introduced because, for example, only \nhigh performers and/or hospitals not impacted or better resourced would choose to submit data, \nwhich would render comparisons between hospitals with different circumstances not in keeping \nwith the program goal of national comparison.  In addition, a number of other factors could also \ncontribute to our ability to accurately calculate a national comparison.  For example, geographic \ndifferences in COVID-19 incidence rates and COVID-19 related hospitalizations and differences \nresulting from changes in referral and hospitalization patterns could both impact the national \ncomparability of optionally submitted data.  Because the HAC Reduction Program relies on a \nrelative scoring methodology, we believe that it would be inappropriate and could disparately \nimpact hospitals to include data from quarters excepted under CMS guidance for the PHE for \nCOVID-19 in our calculation of hospitals\u2019 performance for the program.   \nFinally, although the ECE we granted for the HAC Reduction Program has ended, with \ndata collection and reporting requirements resuming July 1, 2020, we understand that geographic \ndifferences in COVID-19 incidence continue to change during the PHE for COVID-19.  To \nmaintain flexibility for addressing the impact of COVID-19 on the HAC Reduction Program and \ndetermine how best to implement the program equitably, we are announcing that if, as a result of \nthe extension of the ECE for the whole country that we grant without a request or the submission \nof individual ECE requests, we do not have enough HAC Reduction Program data to reliably \nmeasure national performance, we may propose to not score hospitals based on such limited data", "summary": " CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 B-F 47: Not releasable to the public UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW:  This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential .

If we grant another ECE in the future, we would not require that hospitals report the \nexcepted data for the duration of the ECE.  Although a hospital may voluntarily report data \nduring the ECE, we may determine that such data will not be used for scoring purposes.  We \nwould still require that hospitals report the non-excepted data.  However, we may determine that \nit would be inappropriate to score such data or base payment adjustments on it because of \nreliability concerns.  For illustrative purposes only, if a PHE excepted enough quarters from the \nHAC Reduction Program\u2019s 24-month performance period to lead to unreliable measure \ncalculations, we might consider not scoring for the fiscal year because the sample may not be \nlarge enough to calculate reliable measure results for scoring purposes.  Although the data itself \nmay be accurate, the measure(s) may not meet the reliability standards because of the small \nsample of the remaining non-excepted part of the performance period.  In addition, in the \nscenario we describe above, it is likely that only larger hospitals would be able to meet the \nrequired case minimums to be scored in the non-excepted part of the performance period.  We \nmay conclude that only scoring those remaining large hospitals will not produce an accurate \nnational comparison of hospitals.  Alternatively, if we do not extend the ECE to cover Q3 and \nQ4 2020, it is possible that a majority of providers may still submit individual ECE requests for \nthose quarters and it is possible that so many hospitals will submit individual ECE requests that \nwe will not be able to produce a reliable national comparison.

We stated that, upon a hospital\u2019s request, we \nwill consider providing an exception from the Hospital VBP Program requirements to hospitals \naffected by natural disasters or other extraordinary circumstances (78 FR 50704 through 50706). \nSpecifically, we stated that we interpreted the minimum number of cases and measures \nrequirement in sections 1886(o)(1)(C)(ii)(III) and (IV) of the Act to not include any measures or \ncases for which a hospital has submitted data during a performance period for which the hospital \nhas been granted a Hospital VBP Program ECE.  \nIn the May 8th COVID-19 IFC (85 FR 27550), we modified the Hospital VBP Program\u2019s \nECE policy to allow us to grant ECE exceptions to hospitals which have not requested them \nwhen we determine that an extraordinary circumstance that is out of their control, such as an act \nof nature (for example, a hurricane) or PHE (for example, the COVID-19 pandemic), affects an \nentire region or locale, in addition to retaining the individual ECE request policy (85 FR 27597 \nthrough 27598).  We stated that if we grant an ECE to hospitals located in an entire region or \nlocale under this revised policy and, as a result of granting that ECE, one or more hospitals \nlocated in that region or locale does not report the minimum number of cases and measures \nrequired to enable us to calculate a TPS for that hospital for the applicable program year, the \nhospital will be excluded from the Hospital VBP Program for the applicable program year.  We \nalso stated that a hospital that does not report the minimum number of cases or measures for a \nprogram year will not receive a 2 percent reduction to its base operating diagnosis-related group \n(DRG) payment amount for each discharge in the applicable program year, and will also not be \neligible to receive any value-based incentive payments for the applicable program year.

Update to the Hospital VBP ECE Granted in Response to the PHE for COVID-19 \n We continue to believe that the Hospital VBP Program data we have excepted serves \nmultiple purposes, including allowing us to understand the impact of COVID-19 on quality of \ncare.  Furthermore, the HAI measures in the Hospital VBP Program are not abstracted from \nclaims and are calculated based on data submitted to the CDC through the NHSN.  We recognize \nthat the CDC separately collects the same data for epidemiological surveillance and that \nhospitals may have other reporting requirements which are not affected by our ECE (for \nexample, state requirements).  We are concerned with the national comparability of these data \ndue to the geographic differences of COVID-19 incidence rates and hospitalizations along with \ndifferent impacts resulting from different state and local law and policy changes implemented in \nresponse to COVID-19.  For these reasons, and as discussed more fully below, we are revising \nthe current ECE we granted for the Hospital VBP Program with respect to first and second \nquarter CY 2020 excepted data.  Under the revised ECE, we will not use any first or second \nquarter CY 2020 excepted Hospital VBP data that hospitals optionally reported to calculate total \nperformance scores for the FY 2022 through FY 2025 program years or baseline scores for the \nFY 2024 through FY 2030 program years.

CY 2019 Fourth Quarter Hospital VBP Program HAI and HCAHPS Data \nWe excepted hospitals from the requirement to report fourth quarter CY 2019 HAI and \nHCAHPS data for the HVBP Program to alleviate the reporting burden on hospitals that were \nresponding to the PHE for COVID-19 that would otherwise be required to report these data by \nthe May 18, 2020 and April 1, 2020 submission deadlines, respectively.  However, we believe \nthat the quality measure data regarding care provided prior to the PHE for COVID-19 would not \nbe affected.  Additionally, as of April 2020, 92.6 percent of hospitals submitted fourth quarter \nCY 2019 HAI data.  Therefore, we are not making changes to the Hospital VBP Program ECE \nthat we granted with respect to these data for the PHE for COVID-19 and will include all \nvoluntarily reported measure data for the HCAHPS survey and the five NHSN HAI measures \nwhen we calculate hospital TPSs for the FY 2021 program year, as well as when we calculate \nbaseline data for the FY 2023 program year.  Because we did not except fourth quarter CY 2019 \nclaims-based data for the Hospital VBP Program, we will also include those data when we \ncalculate hospital TPSs for the FY 2021 through FY 2024 program years and baseline data for \nthe FY 2026 through FY 2029 program years.  \nii.

Although we \npermitted hospitals to voluntarily report these data, we aim to have the most representative \ncomparison of hospital performance as possible and do not wish to unfairly penalize hospitals \nthat were responding to COVID-19.  We believe that using first and second quarter CY 2020 \noptionally reported data may not provide an accurate national assessment of hospital \nperformance for multiple reasons.  First, if only the optionally submitted data is used, it may not \nprovide an accurate national comparison as it is possible that there may be reporting bias \nintroduced by voluntary submission.  Reporting bias could be introduced if, for example, only \nhigh performers and/or hospitals not impacted or better resourced would choose to submit data, \nhindering comparisons between hospitals with different circumstances and preventing the \nprogram from keeping with its goal of national comparison.  A number of other factors could \nalso contribute to CMS\u2019 ability to generate an accurate national comparison.  For example, \ngeographic differences in COVID-19 incidence rates and COVID-19 related hospitalizations and \ndifferences resulting from changes in referral and hospitalization patterns could both impact the \nnational comparability of optionally submitted data.  We believe that it would be inappropriate to \ninclude optionally submitted data regarding care provided during first and second quarter CY \n2020 in our calculation of a hospital\u2019s TPS.  \nAccordingly, for these reasons, we will not use any first or second quarter CY 2020 \nexcepted Hospital VBP data to calculate total performance scores for the FY 2022 through FY \n2025 program years or baseline scores for the FY 2024 through FY 2030 program years to avoid \nunfairly penalizing hospitals.", "summary": " CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 B-F 59 is for internal government use only  and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information .

To maintain flexibility for addressing the impact of COVID-19 on the Hospital VBP \nProgram and determine how best to implement the program equitably, we are announcing in this \nIFC  that if, as a result of the extension of the ECE for the whole country that we grant without a \nrequest or the submission of individual ECE requests, we do not have enough data to reliably \nmeasure national performance, we may propose to not score hospitals based on such limited data \nor make the associated payment adjustments to facilities under the Hospital VBP Program for the \naffected program year.  If we grant another ECE in the future, we would not require that \nhospitals report the excepted data for the duration of the ECE.  Although a hospital may \nvoluntarily report data during the ECE, we may determine that it would be inappropriate to use \nsuch data for scoring purposes.  We would still require that hospitals report the non-excepted \ndata.  However, we may determine that it would be inappropriate to score such data or base \npayment adjustments on it because of reliability concerns.  For example, if we granted an ECE \nthat excepted hospitals from the requirement to report data for 11 of the 12 months of a given \nperformance period, we would consider not scoring or applying payment adjustments for the \nassociated program year because data from the one non-excepted month may not be large enough \nto calculate reliable measure results.  Although the data itself may be accurate, the measure(s) \nmay not meet the reliability standards because of the small sample of the remaining non-\nexcepted part of the performance period.  In addition, in the scenario we describe above, it is \nplausible that only larger hospitals would be able to meet the required case minimums to be \nscored in the non-excepted part of the performance period.

Although the data itself may be accurate, the measure(s) may not meet the \nreliability standards because of the small sample of the remaining non-excepted part of the \nperformance period.  In addition, in the scenario we describe above, it is likely that only larger \nfacilities would be able to meet the required minimum number of eligible SNF stays to be scored \nin the non-excepted part of the performance period.  We may conclude that only scoring those \nremaining large facilities will not produce an accurate national comparison of SNFs.  \nAlternatively, if we do not extend the ECE to cover Q3 and Q4 2020, it is possible that a \nmajority of SNFs may still submit individual ECE requests for those quarters and it is possible \nthat so many SNFs will submit individual ECE requests that we will not be able to produce a \nreliable national comparison.

At this time, we are not applying this updated ECE policy to the \nSNF VBP Program.

Revised Performance Period for the FY 2022 SNF VBP Program  \nThe performance period for the FY 2022 SNF VBP Program is FY 2020 (84 FR 38822). \nThe ECE for the PHE for COVID-19 excepts 6 months of claims data from the calculation of the \nSNFRM during the performance period of the FY 2022 SNF VBP Program.  \nWe are concerned that using qualifying claims during only the remaining 6 months of FY \n2020 (October 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 (Q4 2019), and July 1, 2020 through \nSeptember 30, 2020 (Q3 2020)) for all SNFs nationwide to calculate the SNFRM for the FY \n2022 Program will not yield measure scores that reliably reflect quality of care as determined by \nhospital readmission rates because the reliability of the SNFRM rate is related to sample size.  \nWe distinguish between ECEs that grant exceptions for a limited number of SNFs on a case-by-\ncase basis (that is, if a SNF submits an ECE form with appropriate supporting evidence), which \nwould yield an acceptable reflection of those SNFs\u2019 performance, and blanket ECEs that grant \nexceptions for all SNFs nationwide, which may decrease the likelihood that measure \nperformance would reflect the quality of care across a large number of SNFs.  Furthermore, the \nNQF endorsed the SNFRM as a one-year measure.26  In line with NQF endorsement, the \nperformance period and baseline period SNFRM rate for a program year has been calculated \nbased on one year of data since the Program\u2019s inception.  Our internal analysis indicates that \ncalculating the SNFRM based on 6 months data for all SNFs nationwide would decrease the \nSNFRM\u2019s reliability by approximately one-third compared to calculating the SNFRM based on \none year of data, resulting in unacceptably low measure reliability.  This situation differs from, \nfor example, calculating the SNFRM based on 6-months of data for only several SNFs, which \n \n26 From https://www.qualityforum.org/Measures_Reports_Tools.aspx, click \u201cNQF-Endorsed Measures (QPS)\u201d \nunder \u201cFind Measures\u201d then search \u201c2510\u201d to view the SNFRM.", "summary": " The performance period for the FY 2022 SNF VBP Program is FY 2020 (84 FR 38822) The ECE for the PHE for COVID-19 excepts 6 months of claims data from the calculation of the SNFRM during the performance period of the . performance period .

We do not \nbelieve it is appropriate to calculate the SNFRM in such a way that does not align with NQF \nendorsement and may decrease the likelihood that the SNFRM reliably reflects the quality of \ncare provided by those SNFs.  Therefore, we are revising the performance period for the FY \n2022 SNF VBP Program.  The revised performance period for the FY 2022 SNF VBP program \nwill include data from: April 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 and July 1, 2020 through \nSeptember 30, 2020.  We note that this 12-month period includes 6 months of FY 2019 data and \n6 months FY 2020 data, but does not include the 6 months of data that we excepted for the SNF \nVBP Program under the ECE for the PHE for COVID-19.  Eligible SNF stays with admissions \nduring this revised 12-month period, April 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 and July 1, 2020 \nthrough September 30, 2020, will be included in performance period SNFRM calculations for \nthe FY 2022 SNF VBP Program.  We believe using data from these two periods, which \ncombines 9 months of data prior to the start of the PHE for COVID-19 and 3 months of data \nafter the end of the ECE we granted for this program, will provide sufficiently reliable data for \nevaluating SNF performance that can be used for FY 2022 scoring.  We selected this \nperformance period data as it was the most operationally feasible, did not use data from FY 2018 \n(the baseline period for the SNF VBP FY 2022 program year), and provided the least overlap \nwith performance periods for other program years.    \nWe are aware that the revised performance period for the FY 2022 Program overlaps with \nthe performance period of the FY 2021 Program (FY 2019) by 6 months.  However, in order to \nensure that 12 months of claims data are used to calculate the SNFRM, we believe that this is the \nmost feasible option.

NCD Procedural Volumes for Facilities and Practitioners to Maintain Medicare Coverage \nNational Coverage Determinations (NCDs) are determinations by the Secretary with \nrespect to whether or not a particular item or service is covered nationally under title XVIII of \nthe Act.  Some NCDs include procedural volume requirements that facilities and/or practitioners \nmust meet as conditions of coverage for specific items and services.  If those volume \nrequirements are not satisfied, Medicare payment would not be permitted.  On March 18, 2020, \nCMS encouraged hospitals and practitioners to delay certain non-essential procedures due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic.27  On June 9, 2020, as coronavirus disease-related healthcare demand \ndecreased, CMS found it was important to safely resume care to treat ongoing health needs that \nhad been postponed and issued guidance that hospitals could resume providing these services.28  \nEven so, as a result of the PHE for COVID-19, hospitals and practitioners have performed fewer \nnon-essential procedures for several months and as a result may not be able to meet certain \nprocedural volume requirements that are set forth in these NCDs.  \nFour NCDs set forth such procedural volume requirements.

Limits on COVID-19 and Related Testing without an Order and Expansion of Testing Order \nAuthority   \nIn this IFC, we are establishing that one COVID-19 diagnostic test and one of each other \nrelated test (as listed in the May 8th COVID-19 IFC) without an order from a physician or other \npractitioner is reasonable and necessary for Medicare payment purposes. For the COVID-19 and \nother related diagnostic tests for which an order is required, we are also establishing a policy \nwhereby tests can be covered when ordered by a pharmacist or other healthcare professional who \nis authorized to order diagnostic laboratory tests in accordance with state scope of practice and \nother pertinent laws.  \nIn the May 8th COVID-19 IFC, CMS stated that, given the critical importance of \nexpanding COVID-19 testing to combat the pandemic and the heightened risk that the disease \npresents to Medicare beneficiaries during the PHE for COVID-19, Medicare would not require \nan order from a physician or other applicable practitioner for COVID-19 testing.  We amended \nour regulation at 42 CFR 410.32(a) to remove the requirement that otherwise covered COVID-19 \ndiagnostic laboratory tests are covered only based on the order of a treating physician or other \npractitioner.29  In addition, we removed the ordering requirement for coverage of a diagnostic \nlaboratory test for influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, a type of common respiratory \nvirus, but only when these tests are furnished in conjunction with a COVID-19 diagnostic \nlaboratory test as medically necessary in the course of establishing or ruling out a COVID-19 \ndiagnosis.  We also noted that FDA-authorized COVID-19 serology tests are included as covered \ntests during the PHE for COVID-19, as they are reasonable and necessary under section \n \n29 The list of COVID-19, Influenza, and RSV clinical diagnostic laboratory tests is available at \nhttps://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-ifc-2-flu-rsv-codes.pdf.", "summary": " CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB  08/24/20 B-H 71: Not released to the public unless authorized by law .

This \nlimitation on tests without a physician/other practitioner order will apply beginning on the \neffective date of this rule, and any tests furnished prior to the effective date will not be \nconsidered for purposes of this limit on tests without a physician or other practitioner order.  In \nother words, if a beneficiary received a test or multiple tests without an order before the effective \ndate of this rule, these tests would not count toward the limit of one test without a physician or \nother practitioner order under this rule.  We believe that this approach will provide sufficient \nnotice for laboratories to set up the systems and processes necessary to require an order beyond \none test. For the COVID-19 and other related diagnostic tests for which an order is required, we \nare also establishing a policy whereby the tests can be covered when ordered by a pharmacist or \nother healthcare professional who is authorized to order diagnostic laboratory tests in accordance \nwith state scope of practice and other pertinent laws.   \nJust as the previous policy was developed based on what was known about COVID-19 at \nthe time, as additional information has become available, policies require modification.  This \napproach is consistent with the CDC\u2019s introductory statement in its July 2, 2020 testing guidance \nthat \u201crecommendations for SARS-CoV-2 testing have been developed based on what is currently \nknown about COVID-19 and are subject to change as additional information becomes", "summary": " Previously policy allowed for broad coverage of multiple instances of COVID-19 testing for a single beneficiary without a physician or other practitioner order .

Our determination to \nrevise the May 8th IFC policy is due both to the significant potential for fraud, waste, and abuse, \nas well as public health and safety issues that would arise from beneficiaries being subjected to \nrepeated testing without proper medical attention or oversight, including public health issues \nwith the ongoing spread of COVID-19, as outlined by CDC guidance on specific patient \ncategories31  that has been published in the May 8th COVID-19 IFC.     \nFirst, laboratory testing has been a significant source of fraud and abuse in the Medicare \nprogram.  In one recent example from September 2019, CMS, along with our law enforcement \npartners, undertook a landmark investigation and prosecution of fraudulent genetic cancer \ntesting, resulting in charges against 35 defendants associated with dozens of telemedicine \ncompanies and cancer genetic testing laboratories for their alleged participation in one of the \nlargest healthcare fraud schemes ever charged.  According to the charges, the defendants \nfraudulently billed Medicare for genetic testing, using telemarketers to make phone calls and \nother unsolicited contacts with Medicare beneficiaries to fraudulently bill more than $2.1 billion \nto the Medicare program..32  \nWe have already found that similar schemes are occurring whereby fraudulent \nlaboratories and telemarketing companies are directly contacting beneficiaries, oftentimes using \nstolen identifying information, to solicit items and services payable by Medicare under the guise \n \n30 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html. \n31 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html. \n32 https://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/media-materials/2019/geneticscam/index.asp.", "summary": " CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB  08/24/20 B-H 73: Not releasable to the public unless authorized to receive the information .

An HHS Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) fraud \nalert33 describes situations in which scammers are offering unapproved and illegitimate COVID-\n19 tests and other services to Medicare beneficiaries in exchange for personal details, including \nMedicare information.  However, the services are unapproved and illegitimate. Fraudsters are \ntargeting beneficiaries in a number of ways, including telemarketing calls, text messages, social \nmedia platforms, and door-to-door visits.  The personal information collected can be used to \nfraudulently bill federal healthcare programs and commit medical identity theft.  In addition, if \nMedicare denies the claim for an unapproved test, the beneficiary could be responsible for the \ncost.  The availability of broad COVID-19 and related testing without an order significantly \nincreases the risk and scope of these fraud schemes, leading not only to considerable risk to \ntaxpayer dollars, but also potential physical and financial harm to Medicare beneficiaries.   \nIn addition to our concerns about previous laboratory schemes being applied to COVID-\n19 testing itself, the risk is exacerbated by the ability of the laboratory to perform add-on tests, \nsuch as to confirm or rule-out diagnoses other than COVID-19.  The HHS-OIG has recognized \nthat \u201c[r]elaxation of the [ordering] rules could allow unscrupulous actors more leeway for \nfraudulent billing of unnecessary add-on testing,\u201d and announced in June 2020 that it was \nundertaking a trend analysis for potential fraud and abuse with COVID-19 add-on testing.34   \nIn addition to our concerns about potential fraud, we believe that broad COVID-19 \ntesting without the order of any healthcare professional\u2014including testing for the related \nconditions identified in the May 8th COVID-19 IFC\u2014may result in a beneficiary not receiving \nthe medical attention and oversight required to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is applied \n \n33 https://oig.hhs.gov/coronavirus/fraud-alert-covid19.asp. \n34 https://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/workplan/summary/wp-summary-0000489.asp.", "summary": " An HHS Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) fraud alert describes situations in which scammers are offering unapproved and illegitimate tests and other services to Medicare beneficiaries in exchange for personal details .

Allowing testing to occur without \nproper medical attention or oversight can lead to direct or indirect harm to beneficiaries, their \nfamilies and their contacts, from a variety of perspectives, including the fact that the beneficiary \nmay not receive complete and accurate information on how the test results should be interpreted \nand acted upon (for example, contact tracing and public health precautions) and how the \nbeneficiary should be monitored in the case of a positive test.  \nOf the nearly 1.9 million beneficiaries who have been tested, approximately 83 percent \nhave had only one test performed.  However, claims data from the past 8 months have shown \nthat the number of beneficiaries receiving more than one COVID-19 test has been increasing. \nWhile we do not have data to examine whether these tests are being performed without a \nphysician or other practitioner order, we expect the proportion of beneficiaries who are tested \nmore than once to increase over time until a vaccine or other containment strategy is available to \nmeaningfully reduce the risk of COVID-19.  We believe that allowing Medicare payment for one \ntest without an order will allow beneficiaries access to urgent testing, as we outlined in the May \n8th COVID-19 IFC, yet also provide sufficient opportunity for beneficiaries to seek out the \nmedical care needed to ensure that the test results are interpreted and acted upon appropriately, \nboth from the perspective of the individual beneficiary and also in the context of the area of the \ncountry in which the beneficiary is located.  \nWhile some areas of the country continue to have minimal impact from the disease or are \nseeing the COVID-19 infection curve flattening, other areas are seeing a resurgence.

Testing without healthcare oversight can lead to a bypassing of risk-stratified protocols for \nmanagement of negative COVID-19 test results.  A negative test does not rule out the disease; if \na physician or other appropriate healthcare professional suspects a patient may have COVID-19 \nbased on symptoms or other factors, infection control measures should be implemented \nregardless of test results.  For example, isolation of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2, the \nvirus that causes COVID-19, is a key strategy for preventing further spread of COVID-19.  In \nfact, when infected individuals are separated from others while awaiting their test results, \ntransmission is reduced much more than when individuals are not separated. By having patients \nisolated one to two days earlier, spread of COVID-19 can be reduced significantly.35  When a \nphysician or other health care provider is able to counsel patients who are being tested for \nCOVID-19, beneficiaries may be more likely to isolate or quarantine themselves more quickly, \nwhich may reduce transmission in the community.

In our May 8th COVID-19 IFC, we also established payment mechanisms \nfor specimen collection for COVID-19 testing under the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) and \nOPPS during the PHE for COVID-19.

These provisions of the \nPHSA have also been augmented by later laws, including the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act (PPACA).39  Subtitles A and C of title I of the PPACA reorganized, amended, and \nadded to the provisions of part A of title XXVII of the PHSA relating to group health plans and \nhealth insurance issuers in the group and individual markets.  \nSection 1321(a) of the PPACA provides broad authority for the Secretary to establish \nstandards and regulations to implement the statutory requirements related to Exchanges,40 \nqualified health plans (QHPs), and other components of title I of the PPACA.  Section \n1321(a)(1) of the PPACA directs the Secretary to issue regulations that set standards for meeting \nthe requirements of title I of the PPACA for, among other things, the establishment and \noperation of Exchanges.  \nSection 1321(d) of the PPACA provides that nothing in title I of the PPACA must be \nconstrued to preempt any state law that does not prevent the application of title I of the PPACA.  \nSection 1311(k) of the PPACA specifies that Exchanges may not establish rules that conflict \nwith or prevent the application of regulations issued by the Secretary. \n \n39 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub.

Calculation of Plan Average Premium and State Average Premium under the Federally-\ncertified Risk Adjustment Methodology (\u00a7 153.320)  \nThe HHS risk adjustment methodology applicable to the 2020 benefit year includes the \nstate payment transfer formula and the high-cost risk pool parameters.49  The state payment \ntransfer formula includes a set of cost adjustment terms that require transfers to be calculated at \nthe geographic rating area level for each plan (that is, we calculate separate transfer amounts for \neach rating area in which a risk adjustment covered plan operates).  It also includes a 14 percent \nadministrative cost reduction to the statewide average premium.  The state payment transfer \nformula generally calculates the difference between the revenues required by a plan, based on the \nhealth risk of the plan\u2019s enrollees, and the revenues that the plan can generate for those enrollees. \nThese differences are then compared across plans in the state market risk pool50 and converted to \na dollar amount based on the statewide average premium.  The difference between the two \npremium estimates determines whether a plan pays a risk adjustment charge or receives a risk \nadjustment payment.51   \n \n46 See section 1321(c)(1) of the PPACA.

Background \nCMS develops and publicly posts a 5-star rating system for Medicare Advantage (MA) \nand Part D plans based on its authority to disseminate comparative information, including about \nquality, to beneficiaries under sections 1851(d) and 1860D-1(c) of the Act and authority to \ncollect various types of quality data under section 1852(e) of the Act. The Star Rating system for \nMA and Part D plans is also the basis for determining quality bonus payment (QBP) status for \nMA plans under section 1853(o) of the Act and the amount of beneficiary rebates under section \n1854(b) of the Act.  As background, approximately $12 billion for 2020 will be paid as part of \nQBPs in the form of higher benchmarks for both Individual and Employer Group Waiver Plans, \nwhich represent about 4.35 percent of the total MA benchmarks.  Cost plans under section 1876 \nof the Act are also included in the MA and Part D Star Rating system, as codified at 42 CFR \n417.472(k).   \nThe Star Ratings are generally based on measures of performance during a period that is \n2 calendar years before the year for which the Star Ratings are issued; for example, 2022 Star \nRatings will generally be based on performance during 2020.  We use a variety of data sources to \nmeasure quality and performance of contracts, such as CMS administrative data, surveys of \nenrollees, information from health and drug plans, and data collected by CMS contractors.  \nVarious regulations require plans to report on quality improvement and quality assurance and to \nprovide data which we can use to help beneficiaries compare plans (for example, \u00a7\u00a7 417.472(j) \nand (k), 422.152(b), 423.153(c), and 423.156).  In addition, we can require plans to report \nstatistics and other information in specific categories (\u00a7\u00a7 422.516 and 423.514).

Specifically, these provisions \nprovide, respectively, for an increase in the benchmark against which MA organizations bid and \nin the portion of the savings between the bid and the benchmark available to the MA \norganization to use as a rebate.

The Star Ratings disaster \npolicy for extreme and uncontrollable circumstances was developed with natural disasters such \nas hurricanes and wildfires in mind.  Those types of emergencies typically impact well-defined \ngeographic areas. The policy uses declarations by the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n(FEMA) of counties or county-equivalents as Individual Assistance areas that make up all or part \nof a contract\u2019s service area, as well as whether the contract's service area is within an \n\u201cemergency area\u201d during an \u201cemergency period\u201d as defined in section 1135(g) of the Act, as a \ncondition for applying an adjustment to how the Star Ratings are calculated for the contract.  \nContracts with a certain minimum percentage of enrollees residing in an area declared as an \nIndividual Assistance area are eligible for Star Ratings adjustments for extreme and \nuncontrollable circumstances.

Background \nOn March 17, 2020, we announced (https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-\nsheets/medicare-telemedicine-health-care-provider-fact-sheet) the expansion of payment for \ntelehealth services on a temporary and emergency basis pursuant to waiver authority added under \nsection 1135(b)(8) of the Act by the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental \nAppropriations Act, 2020 (Pub. L. 116-123, enacted March 6, 2020) such that Medicare can pay \nfor telehealth services, including office, hospital, and other visits furnished by physicians and \nother practitioners to patients located anywhere in the country, including in a patient\u2019s place of \nresidence, starting March 6, 2020.  In the context of the PHE for COVID-19, we recognize that \nphysicians and other healthcare professionals are faced with new challenges regarding potential \nexposure risks, including for Medicare beneficiaries, for healthcare providers, and for members \nof the community at large.  For example, the CDC has urged healthcare professionals to make \nevery effort to interview persons under investigation for infection by telephone, text messaging \nsystem, or video conference instead of in-person (85 FR 27582).  In the March 31st COVID-19 \nIFC, to facilitate the use of telecommunications technology as a safe substitute for in-person \nservices, CMS added on an interim basis many services to the list of eligible Medicare telehealth \nservices, eliminating frequency limitations and other requirements associated with particular \nservices furnished via telehealth, and clarifying several payment rules that apply to other services \nthat are furnished using telecommunications technologies that can reduce exposure risks (85 FR \n19232).", "summary": " CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 B-K 106 INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE to the public UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW:  This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential .

In that IFC, we also stated that we believe that participation \nin this activity would likely result in improved outcomes by improving the collection of data \nclinicians use for the care of their patients as they monitor and manage COVID-19 and drive care \nimprovements (85 FR 19277).  We stated that we believe that encouraging clinicians to utilize an \nopen source clinical data repository or clinical data registry for data reporting will bring the \nresults of their research to the forefront of healthcare far quicker than if it goes through the cycle \nof peer review and publishing (85 FR 19277).  In addition, we stated that we believe that \ncentralized data could improve clinical practice and care delivery (85 FR 19277).   \nb.

Requirement for Long-Term Care (LTC) Facilities to Test Facility Residents and Staff for \nCOVID-19 \nUnder sections 1866 and 1902 of the Act, providers of services seeking to participate in \nthe Medicare or Medicaid program, or both, must enter into an agreement with the Secretary or \nthe state Medicaid agency, as appropriate.  LTC facilities seeking to be Medicare and Medicaid \nproviders of services must be certified as meeting federal participation requirements. LTC \nfacilities include skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) for Medicare and nursing facilities (NFs) for \nMedicaid.  The federal participation requirements for SNFs, NFs, and dually certified facilities, \nare set forth in sections 1819 and 1919 of the Act and codified in the implementing regulations at \n42 CFR part 483, subpart B.   \nSections 1819(d)(4)(B) and 1919(d)(4)(B) of the Act explicitly authorize the Secretary to \nissue any regulations deemed necessary to protect the health and safety of residents.  Sections \n1819(d) (3) and 1919(d)(3) of the Act authorize the Secretary to establish criteria for assessing a \nfacility\u2019s compliance with such regulations with respect to infection control.  Under the explicit \ninstructions of Congress, existing regulations at \u00a7 483.80 require facilities to establish and \nmaintain an infection control program designed to provide a safe, sanitary, and comfortable \nenvironment in which residents reside and to help prevent the development and transmission of \ndisease and infection.  \nAfter several months facing the effects of COVID-19, we believe there exists a need to \nstrengthen the requirements for LTC facilities to better protect residents, members of a high-risk \npopulation.  As demonstrated by the PHE for COVID-19, a strong infection control program is \ncritical to protect the health and safety of both residents and healthcare personnel of LTC \nfacilities.

To support national efforts to control the spread of COVID-19, we are revising the \nLTC facility infection control regulations at \u00a7 483.80 to establish a new requirement for LTC \nfacilities to test their facility residents and staff, including individuals providing services under \narrangement and volunteers.

LTC Facility Resident and Staff Testing \nThe CDC published guidelines titled, Testing Guidelines for Nursing Homes, which note \nthat, \u201cNursing home residents are at high risk for infection, serious illness, and death from \nCOVID-19. Testing for [COVID-19]\u2026 can detect current infections\u2026among residents in \nnursing homes.  Testing is an important addition to other infection prevention and control \nrecommendations aimed at preventing [COVID-19] from entering nursing homes, detecting \ncases quickly, and stopping transmission.\u201d71  CMS recognizes the need for  facilities to protect \nLTC facility staff while preventing the spread of COVID-19 within the facility. As a result, we \nare amending the current infection control requirements for LTC facilities at \u00a7 483.80 by adding \na paragraph (h) that requires a facility to test all of its residents and facility staff for COVID-19. \nUnder this requirement, \u201cstaff\u201d are considered any individuals employed by the facility, any \n \n70 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (2020).

We have already found that schemes are occurring whereby fraudulent laboratories \nand telemarketing companies are directly contacting beneficiaries, oftentimes using stolen \nidentifying information, to solicit items and services payable by Medicare under the guise of \nCOVID-19 treatment or prevention.

The financial impact of this fraud risk is exacerbated by the \nability of the laboratory to perform expensive add-on tests, such as to confirm or rule-out \ndiagnoses other than COVID-19, that are not medically necessary.   \nWe also believe that allowing Medicare payment for one test without an order will allow \nbeneficiaries access to urgent testing, as we outlined in the May 8th COVID-19 IFC, yet also \nprovide sufficient opportunity for beneficiaries to seek out the medical care needed to ensure that \nthe test results are interpreted and acted upon appropriately, both from the perspective of the \nindividual beneficiary and also in the context of the area of the country in which the beneficiary \n \n75 https://oig.hhs.gov/coronavirus/fraud-alert-covid19.asp.", "summary": " CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 C 133: Not released to the public unless authorized to receive the information .

Statement of Need \nThroughout this IFC, we discuss several changes to payment and coverage policies \nintended to allow healthcare providers and health insurance issuers maximum flexibility to \nminimize the spread of COVID-19 among Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, consumers of \nhealth insurance coverage in the individual and small group insurance markets, healthcare \npersonnel, and the community at large, and increase capacity to address the needs of their \npatients.  The flexibilities and changes contained within this IFC are responsive to this \ndeveloping pandemic emergency and to recent legislation that gives us additional authority.  \nGiven the potentially catastrophic impact to public health, it is difficult to estimate the economic \nimpact of the spread of COVID-19 under current payment rules compared to the rules issued in \nthis IFC.  \n We believe that the needs of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and consumers of \nhealth insurance coverage in the individual and small group insurance markets suffering from \nCOVID-19 will likely test the capacity of the healthcare system over the coming months.  Our \npolicies implemented in this IFC will provide flexibilities, during the PHE for COVID-19, to \nphysicians and other practitioners, and clinical laboratories.  Additionally, the policies and \nregulatory updates implemented in this IFC will increase the affordability and support continuity \nof health insurance coverage for consumers in the individual and small group (or merged) market \nduring the PHE for COVID-19. \nB.

In addition, AOs \nand Exempt States (ESs) will also need to update their laboratory standards and policies and \nprocedures to comply with the new federal regulatory changes.  We have provided an assessment \nof the impact of estimated costs of these changes in Tables 7 and 8.   \nExecutive Order 13771, titled Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, \nwas issued on January 30, 2017 and requires that the costs associated with significant new \nregulations \u201cshall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs \nassociated with at least two prior regulations.\u201d  This IFC\u2019s designation under Executive Order \n13771, titled Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs (82 FR 9339), which was \nissued on January 30, 2017, will be informed by public comments received. \nThe RFA requires agencies to analyze options for regulatory relief of small entities, if a \nrule has a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

For purposes of this IFC, we expect that approximately 30 percent (n=77,024) of the \ntotal CLIA certified laboratories (n=256,747) could potentially be performing SARS-CoV-2 \ntests.  Further, based on data from the CLIA website, we are estimating that 75 percent of the \nlaboratories have a CoW (n=57,768) and 25 percent have a Certificate of PPM, CoC, CoA, or \nCoR (n=19,256).  Each individual EUA test system authorized by the FDA specifies the settings \nin which the tests are authorized to be used during the PHE for COVID-19.  Generally, COW \nand PPM laboratories include, but are not limited to, the following types of facilities:  physician \noffice laboratories; pharmacies; skilled nursing/nursing facilities; and other types of point-of-care \nfacilities.

For purposes \nof section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside \nof a metropolitan statistical area and has fewer than 100 beds.  There are approximately 905 \nsmall rural hospitals in the U.S.  Of the 905 small rural hospitals, approximately 500 are \nsubsection (d) hospitals paid under IPPS and are subject to the HAC Reduction Program and \nHRRP.

In addition, these two states would need to develop a CMP \nstructure to impose CMPs that is equivalent to CMS and is based on their updated standards. In \norder to determine compliance with the reporting requirements, the State Agencies would be \nrequired to perform additional surveys on 5 percent of CoW and 5 percent of PPM laboratories. \nAs previously stated, these two type of laboratories are not routinely surveyed.  The total number \nof CoW laboratories as of March 2020 is 193,474.  Five percent of 193,474 is 9,674 so for the \nduration of the IFC (3 years), a total of 3,225 CoW surveys would need to be performed annually \nacross all State Agencies.  The total number of PPM laboratories as of March 2020 is 30,120.  \nFive percent of 30,120 is 1,506 so for the 3 years that this IFC would be in place, a total of 502 \nPPM surveys would need to be performed annually across all State Agencies.  The combined \nnumber of these surveys that will need to be performed annually over the 3 years of the \ntimeframe of the IFC is 3,727 across all State Agencies.  Over the 3 years that this IFC is in \nplace, one-third of the total number CoW and PPM laboratories would be surveyed each year.  \nThis would ensure that a total of 5 percent of each of these types of laboratories are surveyed \nduring the duration of the PHE for COVID-19 to determine if SARS-CoV-2 requirements are \nmet. Currently, there are no resources available to the State Agencies to perform these additional \nsurveys.  Therefore, this IFC would have a substantial direct effect on state or local governments.  \nThis IFC would also have a direct effect on preempting state laboratory requirements as they \nmust change their current laboratory standards to remain equal to or more stringent than Federal \nlaws when finalized. \nC.

Based on data \nprovided to CMS by the CDC, compliance with this requirement has been greater than \n98 percent since the reporting week ending June 28, 2020.  Although there has been \nunprecedented compliance with the requirement to report, CMS has issued 2,507 citations for \nnoncompliance as of August 10, 2020, with corresponding CMPs imposed.

CoP Requirements for Hospitals and CAHs, and Requirements for LTC Facilities \na.  CoP Requirements for Hospitals and CAHs to Report COVID-19 Data as Specified by the \nSecretary During the PHE for COVID-19  \nSection II.B. of this IFC revises the infection prevention and control requirements for \nhospitals and CAHs to more effectively respond to the specific challenges posed by the COVID-\n19 pandemic.  Specifically, we are adding provisions to require facilities to electronically report \ninformation related to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases in a standardized format \nspecified by the Secretary. Many hospitals are already reporting data in a standardized format \nvoluntarily. As detailed in section IV.G. of this IFC, we currently estimate the cost of these \nreporting requirements to total $212,232,900. This estimate is likely an overestimate of the costs \nassociated with reporting because it assumes that all hospitals will report manually.  Efforts are \nunderway to automate hospital and CAH reporting that have the potential to significantly \ndecrease reporting burden and improve reliability. We anticipate that the need for reporting will \nbe temporary in direct relationship to the duration of the PHE. Existing guidance on reporting, \nwhich may be revised in the future, can be found at \nhttps://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-faqs-hospitals-hospital-laboratory-acute-care-\nfacility-data-reporting.pdf, and these guidance documents will be in CMS\u2019 13891 portal.

Based on data from CDC and states where similar policies have already \nbeen implemented, we anticipate that this will result in widespread testing and significant \nresource use, but catch many cases that might otherwise go undetected.  For example, \nimplementing universal testing in 11 LTC facilities in Maryland increased the total number of \ndetected cases in those facilities from 153 to 507.91  Costs incurred by facilities have potential to \nvary drastically depending on the extent of outbreaks in their respective communities, whether \nthe facility has point-of-care testing, and the size of each facility; however, for some of these \nfacilities the cost of testing may be less than the costs associated with lost productivity and \nrevenue due to unmitigated outbreaks.  We solicit comments on our cost estimates, as well as any \nadditional costs associated with acquiring reagents, test kits, or anything else we may not have \nconsidered. \nBest practices for catching and eliminating these outbreaks, as well as availability of the \ntools necessary to do so, is a quickly changing landscape. As of late July, over 600 point-of-care \nantigen testing devices had already been shipped to LTC facilities nationwide, with plans to \nprovide every facility with their own instrument(s) and tests within 14 weeks.92 This method of \ntesting effectively reduces the cost-per-test from approximately $100 to only $20. These efforts \nto provide every facility with these devices continue, but for the purposes of our estimates below, \nwe assume a cost of $60 per test; this accounts for the potential cost of replacing the antigen \n \n91 Bigelow BF, Tang O, Barshick B, et al.

We are requiring the AOs/ESs to report this \ninformation no later than 10 days after determining a laboratory is not reporting results, as \nrequired under \u00a7\u00a7 493.41 and 493.1100(a).  We assume a one-time cost would range from \n$9,967 to $14,950.  In addition, the AOs and ESs would be required to report to CMS every 10 \ndays those laboratories that have not reported test results as required.  The annual total number of \ntimes each AO and ES is required to report to CMS is 36.5 (365 days/10 days).

This is a total of 20,304 laboratories that would \nbe required to be surveyed annually and that may be impacted by the imposition of CMPs for \nfailing to report SARS-CoV-2 as required.

While we \nbelieve initially the number of laboratories having a CMP imposed would be significantly higher, \nwe postulate that the number of laboratories that will require the imposition of a CMP for not \nreporting SARS-CoV-2 test results will decrease during the PHE for COVID-19.  We believe \nthis decrease will be a result of laboratories implementing the new requirements included in this \nIFC.   \nWe have no data indicating how imposition of the alternative sanction of CMP would \naffect all laboratories.  Prior to the changes included in this IFC, CMPs were not imposed on \nCoW laboratories.  In 2016, CMS imposed 30 CMPs for an average of $35,436 per laboratory; in \n2017, 25 CMPs were imposed for an average of $72,237 per laboratory; and in 2018, 24 CMPs \nwere imposed for an average of $44,230 per laboratory. The average total CMP imposed per \nfined laboratory over the 3-year period was $52,634.  Based on our CMP requirements specific \nto SARS-CoV-2 at 493.1834(d)(2)(iii), we anticipate that would be a range of $1,000 per \nviolation and $500 for each additional day of noncompliance that test results are not reported.  \nFor example, we are providing estimates for a minimum period of 3 days and a maximum period \nof 30 days.  We estimate that the total cost of CMPs imposed across all laboratories collectively \nwould range from $8,122,000 to $62,945,500 (4,061 laboratories x $2000 (3 days) or 4,061 \nlaboratories x $15,500 (30 days)) for laboratories performing SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Furthermore, based on data \nfrom the CLIA website102 we are estimating that 75 percent of the 77,024 laboratories have a \nCoW (n=57,768), and 25 percent have a Certificate of PPM, CoC, CoA, or CoR (n=19,256).  \nGenerally, the types of facilities that have a CoW include, but are not limited to:  physician \noffice laboratories (45%); pharmacies (5%); skilled nursing/nursing facility (6%); and other \ntypes of point-of-care facilities.103  The facilities with PPM generally are physician office \nlaboratories (POL) or other types of point-of-care (POC) facilities.104  We would also estimate \nthat 45 percent of the CoC, CoA, and CoR laboratories would be POLs.

While reporting of SARS-CoV-2 test results affects all \nlaboratories performing this testing, we believe that meeting the new reporting requirements will \nbe more challenging for POL and POC laboratories given that this requirement creates the need \nfor systemic changes to the ability to report results.  If a laboratory does not currently have this \ncapability to report in the form and manner specified by the Secretary, they would need to \nexpeditiously ensure that the laboratory was able to submit the SARS-CoV-2 test results in such \nform and manner, and at such timing and frequency, as the Secretary may prescribe.

Limits on COVID-19 and Related Testing without an Order \nAs discussed in section II.F. of this IFC, we are revising the previous policy outlined in \nthe May 8th COVID-19 IFC, which allowed for broad COVID-19 testing for a single beneficiary \nwithout a physician or other practitioner order by establishing that only a single COVID-19 \ndiagnostic test and one of each other related test (as listed in the May 8th COVID-19 IFC) \nwithout a treating physician or other practitioner order is reasonable and necessary for Medicare \npayment. This limitation on tests without a treating physician/practitioner order will apply \nbeginning on the effective date of this rule, and any tests furnished prior to the effective date \nwould not be considered for purposes of the limit on tests without a physician or eligible \nordering practitioner order. We are also establishing a policy whereby the orders of pharmacists \nand other practitioners that are allowed to order laboratory tests in accordance with state scope of \npractice and other pertinent laws can fulfill the requirements related to orders for covered \nCOVID-19 tests for Medicare patients.
