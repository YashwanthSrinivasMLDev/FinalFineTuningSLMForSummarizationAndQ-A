["### Instruction:\n  #       Summarize the following article:\n\n  #       1 \n  \nCounty Data for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services \n(CLAS County Data) \nEdition Date: November 2023 \nPublic Health Service (PHS) Act section 2719 and its implementing regulations require non-\ngrandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered \nhealth insurance coverage to provide relevant notices in a culturally and linguistically \nappropriate manner. The regulations implementing section 2719 require these plans and issuers \nto make certain accommodations for notices sent to an address in a county meeting a threshold \npercentage of people who are literate only in the same non-English language. This threshold \npercentage is set at 10 percent or more of the population residing in the claimant\u2019s county, as \ndetermined based on American Community Survey (ACS) data published by the United States \nCensus Bureau.\n12 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-2719(e), 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2590.715-2719(e), and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n147.136(e). \n1 The Final Rules for Grandfathered Plans, Preexisting Condition Exclusions, Lifetime and Annual Limits, \nRe\nscissions, Dependent Coverage, Appeals, and Patient Protections Under the Affordable Care Act establish that the \nthreshold percentage of people who are literate only in the same non-English language must be determined based on \nACS data published by the U.S. Census Bureau, 80 FR 72192, 72208 (Nov. 18, 2015), available at \nht\ntps://www.federalregister.gov/d/2015-29294/p-185. \n2 The relevant ACS data set used is the U.S. Census, 2016-20 20 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, \nTable B16001, Language Spoken at Home by Ability to Speak English for the Population 5 Years and Over, \navailable at ht\ntps://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?tid=ACSDT5Y2020.B16001. The Departments note that this \nguidance is also applicable to group health plans, including non-F ederal governmental plans, (whether insured or \nself-insured) offering coverage in the U.S. Territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, \nPuerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and that are subject to the language access standards in PHS Act section \n2719. However, HHS determined that certain PHS Act requirements enacted in the Affordable Care Act are \nappropriately governed by the definition of \"state\u201d at ACA section 1304(d) and therefore will not apply to health \ninsurance issuers in the U.S. Territories. See the 2016 Payment Notice final rule, 80 FR at 10757, 10781, 10862, and \n10863 (amending the definition of \u201cState\u201d in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 144.103 and 154.102).\u201d This analysis applies only to \nhealth insurance governed by the PHS Act. Therefore, as a practical matter, PHS Act, Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code (Code) requirements applicable to group health plans, \nincluding non-Federal governmental plans, such as the language access requirements in PHS Act section 2719,\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            Public Health Service (PHS) Act section 2719 and its implementing regulations require non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers to provide relevant notices in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner .

These FAQs have been prepared jointly by the \nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Treasury (collectively, the \nDepartments). Like previously issued FAQs (available at \nhttps://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resourcecenter/faqs and \nhttp://www.cms.gov/cciio/resources/fact-sheets-and-faqs/index.html), these FAQs answer \nquestions from stakeholders to help people understand the law and promote compliance. \n \nTransparency in Coverage Machine-Readable Files  \n \nThe Transparency in Coverage Final Rules (the TiC Final Rules) require non-grandfathered \ngroup health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered coverage in the group \nand individual markets to disclose, on a public website, information regarding in-network rates \nfor covered items and services, out-of-network allowed amounts and billed charges for covered \nitems and services, and negotiated rates and historical net prices for covered prescription drugs in \nthree separate machine-readable files.\n1 The machine-readable file requirements of the TiC Final \nRules are applicable for plan years (in the individual market, policy years) beginning on or after \nJanuary 1, 2022. The Departments previously announced that they will defer enforcement of the \nrequirements related to machine-readable files disclosing in-network and out-of-network data \nuntil July 1, 2022.\n2 The Departments also previously announced that they will defer enforcement \nof the requirement that plans and issuers publish a machine-readable file related to prescription \ndrugs while they consider, through notice-and-comment rulemaking, whether this requirement \nremains appropriate.3 \n  \nThe TiC Final Rules require plans and issuers to publish all applicable rates, which may include \none or more of the following: negotiated rates, underlying fee schedule rates, or derived amounts \nfor all covered items and services in the In-network Rate File. The Departments specify in the \npreamble to the TiC Final Rules that the In-network Rate File requirement applies to plans and \nissuers regardless of the type of payment model or models under which they provide coverage.\n4 \n                                               \n1 26 CFR 54.9815-2715A3; 29 CFR\u20092590.715-2715A3; and 45 CFR 147.212; 85 FR 72158 (Nov. 12, 2020).\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way .

The TiC Final Rules do not require plans or issuers to develop a \nnew methodology for providing derived amounts. If the plan or issuer uses underlying fee \nschedule rates for calculating cost sharing, the plan or issuer should include the underlying fee \nschedule rates in addition to the negotiated rates or derived amounts. \n \nNotably, the TiC Final Rules require that these rates be reflected in the In-network Rate File as \ndollar amounts. While there are many alternative reimbursement arrangements that do not have a \ndollar amount associated with particular items and services before the item or service is provided \nor rendered, a dollar amount can still be determined in some instances under these models. \nAccordingly, in the preamble to the TiC Final Rules, the Departments provide a list of alternative \nreimbursement arrangements and summarize general reporting expectations for these models, \nwhile acknowledging that this list is not exhaustive, as there may be other alternative \nreimbursement or contracting arrangements in use.\n5 Specifically, the Departments summarize the \ngeneral reporting expectations for several alternative reimbursement arrangements, including \nbundled payment arrangements and capitation arrangements (including sole capitation \narrangements and partial capitation arrangements), reference-based pricing without a defined \nnetwork, reference-based pricing with a defined network, and value-based purchasing. For \nexample, the preamble clarifies that for payment arrangements under which adjustments are \nmade after care is provided, the plan or issuer should disclose the base negotiated rate before \nadjustments are applied.\n6  \n \nAfter the TiC Final Rules were issued, stakeholders have utilized GitHub and other forums to \nraise to the Departments\u2019 attention alternative reimbursement arrangements for which reporting a \ncurrent and accurate dollar amount for items and services in the In-network Rate File before the \nitem or service is provided or rendered may not be possible. Specifically, stakeholders have \nasked the Departments how to report dollar amounts for negotiated rates that result from certain \n\u201cpercentage-of-billed charges\u201d contract arrangements, under which a dollar amount can be \ndetermined only retrospectively because the agreement between the plan or issuer and the in-\nnetwork provider states that the plan or issuer will pay a fixed percentage of the billed charges. It \nis the Departments\u2019 understanding that these types of arrangements are not uncommon for \ncertain types of items or services (such as low-volume procedures or high-cost, outlier inpatient \ncare) and that plans and issuers may enter into these arrangements, in part, because the\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            The TiC Final Rules do not require plans or issuers to develop a new methodology for providing derived amounts .

This safe \nharbor is further described in Q1 and Q2 of these FAQs Part 53. \n \nT\nhe Departments will monitor the implementation of the machine-readable files requirements \nand may revisit this safe harbor in the future, including when access to underlying fee schedules \nbecomes more widely available in connection with the development of pathways for providers to \ntransmit expected charges to plans and issuers in support of the development of advanced \nexplanations of benefits as required under Internal Revenue Code section 9816(f), the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act section 716(f), and the Public Health Service Act section \n2799A-1(f), as added by Section 111 of title I (the No Surprises Act) of division BB of the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.\n7 HHS encourages states that are primary enforcers of \nthis requirement with regard to issuers to take a similar enforcement approach and will not \nregard a state as failing to substantially enforce this requirement if it takes such an approach. \n \nT\nhis safe harbor will not apply to a particular alternative reimbursement arrangement if the \nDepartments determine that the particular arrangement can sufficiently disclose a dollar amount. \nThe Departments encourage the continued utilization of GitHub to submit suggestions on ways \nthe schema should support alternative reimbursement arrangements.  \n \n \nQ\n1: In the In-network Rate File, how can plans and issuers report applicable rates for \nspecific items or services provided under \u201cpercentage-of-billed-charges\u201d contracts if an \nexact dollar amount cannot be determined for those items or services prospectively? \n \nF\nor contractual arrangements under which a plan or issuer agrees to pay an in-network provider a \npercentage of billed charges and is not able to assign a dollar amount to an item or service prior \nto a bill being generated, plans and issuers may report a percentage number, in lieu of a dollar \namount. For example, if a negotiated arrangement for a particular item or service provides for \nreimbursement for 70 percent of billed charges, and the plan or issuer is unable to ascertain the \ndollar amount that will be billed for the item or service in advance, the Departments will permit \nthe plan or issuer to report the in-network rate using the applicable percentage of 70. \n \nD\nocumentation specific to the format requirements for percentage-of-billed-charges\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            The Departments are providing an enforcement safe harbor for plans and issuers that use alternative reimbursement arrangements that do not permit the plans and . issuers to derive with accuracy specific dollar henyamounts contracted for covered items and services in advance of the provision of that item or service .

The virus has been named \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u201d (SARS-\nCoV-2\u201d) and the disease it causes has been named \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d). \nOn January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of \nInternational Concern\u201d.  On January 31, 2020, pursuant to section 319 of the Public Health \nService Act (PHSA) (42 U.S.C. 247d), the Health and Human Services Secretary (the Secretary) \ndetermined that a public health emergency (PHE) exists for the United States to aid the nation\u2019s \nhealthcare community in responding to COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as the PHE for COVID-\n19).  On March 11, 2020, the WHO publicly declared COVID-19 a pandemic.  On March 13, \n2020, President Donald J. Trump (the President) declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national \nemergency. Effective July 25, 2020, the Secretary renewed the January 31, 2020 determination \nthat was previously renewed on April 21, 2020, that a PHE for COVID-19 exists and has existed \nsince January 27, 2020.   \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that some people are \nat higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.1 These higher-risk categories include: \n\u25cf  Older adults, with risk increasing by age. \n\u25cf  People of any age who have certain underlying medical conditions such as: \n++  Cancer. \n \n1 https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e3.htm.\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            The United States is responding to an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) The disease it causes has been named \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u201d The WHO has declared the outbreak a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of ipientInternational Concern\u201d\n  #       ", "### Instruction:\n  #       Summarize the following article:\n\n  #       CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 A 8 \nINFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: \nThis information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential.

Based on the current and projected increases in the COVID-19 incidence rates in the \nUS, observed fatalities in the older adult population, and the impact on health workers who are at \nincreased risk due to treating special populations, it is CMS\u2019 belief that certain regulations \nshould be reviewed and revised as appropriate to offer additional flexibilities in furnishing and \nproviding services to combat the PHE for COVID-19 and to address and minimize the unique \nimpact of the PHE for COVID-19 on other regulatory provisions.

L. 100-578) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. 263a), \nrequiring any laboratory that examines human specimens for the purpose of providing \ninformation for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or impairment of, or the \nassessment of health, of human beings to be certified by the Secretary for the categories of \nexaminations or procedures performed by the laboratory. The implementing regulations at 42 \nCFR part 493 specify the conditions and standards that must be met to achieve and maintain \nCLIA certification.  These conditions and standards strengthen federal oversight of clinical \nlaboratories and help ensure the accuracy and reliability of patient test results.  \nOn March 27, 2020, the President signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic \nSecurity Act (CARES Act) (Pub.

New Enforcement Requirement for LTC Facilities \nUnder sections 1866 and 1902 of the Social Security Act (the Act), providers of services \nseeking to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid program, or both, must enter into an \nagreement with the Secretary or the state Medicaid agency, as appropriate.  LTC facilities \nseeking to be Medicare and Medicaid providers of services must be certified as meeting federal \nparticipation requirements.  LTC facilities include SNFs for Medicare and nursing facilities \n(NFs) for Medicaid. The federal participation requirements for these facilities are specified in \nsections 1819 and 1919 of the Act and in implementing regulations at 42 CFR part 483, subpart \nB.  \nUnder sections 1819(f)(1) and 1919(f)(1) of the Act, the Secretary must assure that the \nenforcement of compliance with the participation requirements are adequate to protect the health, \nsafety, welfare, and rights of residents and to promote the effective use of public moneys. The \nfederal requirements related to enforcement of the requirements for SNFs, NFs, or dually-\ncertified facilities, are set forth in sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act and codified in the \nregulations at 42 CFR part 488, subpart F. Among the remedies available to be imposed for \nnoncompliance with the requirements is a civil money penalty (CMP), as authorized in sections \n1819(h)(2)(B)(ii) and 1919(h)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, and \u00a7\u00a7 488.430 through 488.444.   \n \n6 https://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx.\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            New Enforcement Requirement for LTC Facilities includes SNFs for Medicare and nursing facilities for Medicaid .

This new regulation requires nursing \nhomes to report COVID-19 related facility data to the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network \n(NHSN).  These new CMS reporting requirements do not preclude a facility from following all \nstate and local public health reporting laws and regulations. \nSpecifically, we revised our requirements by adding new provisions at \u00a7\u00a7 483.80(g)(1) \nand (2), to require facilities to electronically report information about COVID-19 in a \nstandardized format and at a frequency specified by the Secretary, but not less than weekly to the \nCDC NHSN. This critical information will provide real-time information on COVID-19 in \nnursing homes, and will be used to monitor trends in infection rates, and inform public health \npolicies.

This is consistent with guidance that was issued in QSO 20-29-NH7 which also \nincluded enforcement policies for the imposition of a CMP for the failure to report to the CDC \nNHSN.   \nWith this IFC, we are furthering enforcement efforts of the recently issued requirements \nat \u00a7 483.80(g)(1) and (2) that facilities report COVID-19 related information to the CDC\u2019s \nNHSN by making revisions to part 488.  These revisions codify enforcement policies that are \nspecifically tailored to reviewing compliance with and imposing CMPs for the failure to report.  \nWe are enforcing the new reporting requirements through the imposition of CMPs for each time \na facility fails to report the required data to the CDC NHSN system.  We believe that CMPs are \nan appropriate enforcement remedy that will facilitate a swift return to compliance with the new \nreporting requirement. Sections 1819(h)(2)(B)(ii)(I) and 1919(h)(3)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act limit the \namount of a CMP to $10,0008 for each day of noncompliance.  We have determined that a \nminimum $1,000 initial CMP, with a $500 incremental increase, is within the authorized CMP \nrange and an appropriate amount to deter noncompliance with this requirement.

For each subsequent time the facility fails to report the requisite COVID-\n19 related data, the amount of the CMP imposed will be increased by $500, which is consistent \nwith sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and 1919(h)(3)(C) of the Act providing for the imposition of \nincrementally more severe fines for repeated deficiencies.  For example, if a facility fails to \nreport in 1 week, a minimum $1,000 CMP will be imposed for that occurrence of \nnoncompliance.  If it fails to report again in the subsequent week that new noncompliance \ndetermination will lead to the imposition of another CMP but in the increased amount of $1,500 \nfor that failure to report.  In this example, if the facility complies with the reporting requirements \nby submitting the required report in a 3rd week, but then subsequently fails to report again in a \nfollowing week, a CMP in the amount of $2,000 for failing to report a third time will be imposed \nfor that missed weekly report (which is $500 more than the last imposed amount).  After each \nCMP is imposed, CMS will place the facility back into compliance, without requiring a Plan of \nCorrection (POC) in accordance with \u00a7 488.408(f).  A facility may still submit a POC if it \nchooses to do so; however, because compliance will be imposed each week and facilities will be \nassessed an increased CMP amount for each subsequent failure to report, a POC will not be \nnecessary.

This specific maximum amount imposed for the \nfailure to report was established to be consistent with the existing CMPs within Category 2 \nnoncompliance.  We believe imposing CMPs in this manner is a fair and effective penalty for the \nfailure to report, as assessed each week.  \nTo support and further codifythese enhanced enforcement efforts, we are adding \n\u00a7 488.447 to impose a minimum CMP amount of $1,000 for the first occurrence of \nnoncompliance with the reporting requirements at \u00a7 483.80(g)(1) and (2), and will increase the \nCMP by $500 for each subsequent time the facility fails to report COVID-19 related data as \nrequired.

Waiving notice and comment is in the public interest because the \nheightened threat to resident health and safety for, widespread infection control noncompliance \nnecessitates the expedited imposition of enforcement remedies.  Additionally, because it is \nimperative to track the incidence and impact of COVID-19 in nursing homes, it is crucial that a \nfinancial penalty be imposed for failure to report. The CMP amounts we codify in this IFC will \nhelp deter noncompliance and encourage facilities to establish procedures that result in prompt \nweekly COVID-19 related data reports for the duration of the PHE for COVID-19. Proper \nenforcement mechanisms designed to deter noncompliant behavior and prompt corrective actions \nwill help to ensure that residents, staff, and the public are safe, and will help provide critical \nCOVID-19 related data to assist CMS and public health authorities in detecting and \nexpeditiously responding to outbreaks. Furthermore, requiring prior notice and comment is \nimpracticable because the PHE for COVID-19 that the CMP amounts are tailored to address may \nexpire or be nearly over before a proposed rule can be finalized. Finally, we think prior notice \nand comment is unnecessary because we have broad discretion under the statute and existing \nCMP regulations to establish a CMP amount, but we are choosing to make our policies more \ntransparent. We believe that a completely transparent CMP structure will help deter \nnoncompliance, encourage timely reporting, and eliminate possible gaps in reporting that could \nhinder the government\u2019s response to the PHE for COVID-19 in specific geographic areas.

Condition of Participation (CoP) Requirements for Hospitals and CAHs to Report COVID-19 \nData As Specified by the Secretary During the PHE for COVID-19  \nUnder sections 1866 and 1902 of the Act, providers of services seeking to participate in \nthe Medicare or Medicaid program, or both, must enter into an agreement with the Secretary or \nthe state Medicaid agency, as appropriate. Hospitals (all hospitals to which the requirements of \n42 CFR part 482 apply, including short-term acute care hospitals, LTC hospitals, rehabilitation \nhospitals, psychiatric hospitals, cancer hospitals, and children\u2019s hospitals) and CAHs seeking to \nbe Medicare and Medicaid providers of services must be certified as meeting federal \nparticipation requirements. Our conditions of participation (CoPs), conditions for coverage \n(CfCs), and requirements set out the patient health and safety protections established by the \nSecretary for various types of providers and suppliers.  The specific statutory authority for \nhospital CoPs is set forth in section 1861(e) of the Act; section 1820(e) of the Act provides \nsimilar authority for CAHs.  The hospital provision authorizes the Secretary to issue any \nregulations he or she deems necessary to protect the health and safety of patients receiving \nservices in those facilities; the CAH provision authorizes the Secretary to issue such other \ncriteria as he or she may require. The CoPs are codified in the implementing regulations at part \n482 for hospitals, and at 42 CFR part 485, subpart F, for CAHs.   \nOur CoPs at \u00a7 482.42 for hospitals and \u00a7 485.640 for CAHs, require that hospitals and \nCAHs, respectively, have active facility-wide programs, for the surveillance, prevention, and \ncontrol of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and other infectious diseases and for the \noptimization of antibiotic use through stewardship. Additionally, the programs must demonstrate \nadherence to nationally recognized infection prevention and control guidelines, as well as to best \npractices for improving antibiotic use where applicable, and for reducing the development and\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            Hospitals and CAHs seeking to be Medicare and Medicaid providers of services must be certified as meeting federal participation requirements .

Our regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 482.42(a)(3) and \n485.640(a)(3) require infection prevention and control program policies to address any infection \ncontrol issues identified by public health authorities.

Examples of data elements that may be required to be reported include \nthings such as the number of staffed beds in a hospital and the number of those that are occupied, \ninformation about its supplies, and a count of patients currently hospitalized who have \nlaboratory-confirmed COVID-19.

Enforcement of Requirements for Hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) to Report \nCOVID-19 Data \nWe believe reporting by hospitals and CAHs is an important tool for supporting \nsurveillance of COVID-19 and we will enforce violations of reporting requirements to the extent \nauthorized by the Secretary.  Should a hospital or CAH fail to consistently report test results \nthroughout the duration of the PHE for COVID-19, it will be non-compliant with the hospital \nand the CAH CoPs set forth at \u00a7\u00a7 482.42(e) and 485.640(d), respectively, and subject to \ntermination as defined at 42 CFR 489.53(a)(3).  We have taken a position on the importance of \nCOVID-19 test results reporting in other provider areas, including use of CMPs for nursing \nhomes that fail to report, and find it prudent to enact penalties for hospitals and CAHs that \nsimilarly fail to report COVID-19 test results.  CMS currently lacks the statutory authority to \nimpose CMPs against hospitals and CAHs; however, intermediate penalties such as CMPs have \nbeen an extremely useful tool in the enforcement of reporting requirements for nursing homes, \nhelping to achieve 98 percent compliance.  Therefore, we will continue to utilize all enforcement \nand payment authorities available to incentivize and promote compliance with all health and \nsafety requirements, as allowed by statute and regulation.\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 8/24/20 B-B 26 INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE to the public UNLESS AUTHORIZED by law:  Unauthorized disclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law .

Requirements for Laboratories to Report SARS-CoV-2 Test Results During the PHE for \nCOVID-19  \nAssuring a rapid and thorough public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic relies \non having complete and comprehensive laboratory testing data, including standardized test \nresults, relevant demographic details, and additional information that can improve both the \nresponse to SARS-CoV-2 and treatment of COVID-19.  These data can contribute to \nunderstanding disease incidence and trends: initiating epidemiologic case investigations, \nassisting with contact tracing, assessing availability and use of testing resources, and identifying \nsupply chain issues for reagents and other material.  Laboratory testing data, in conjunction with \ncase reports and other data, also provide vital guidance for mitigation and control activities. \nSection 18115(a) of the CARES Act requires every laboratory that performs or analyzes a \ntest that is intended to detect SARS- CoV-2 or to diagnose a possible case of COVID-\n19(hereinafter referred to as a \u201cSARS-CoV-2 test\u201d or \u201cCOVID-19 diagnostic test\u201d) to report the \nresults from each such test to the Secretary until the end of the  PHE for COVID\u201319.  In addition, \nthe statute authorizes the Secretary to prescribe the form and manner, and timing and frequency, \nof such reporting.  As indicated in HHS guidance issued on June 4, 2020,11 in an effort to receive \nthese data in the most efficient and effective manner, the Secretary has required that all data be \nreported through existing public health data reporting methods.

L. 100-578) (codified as \namended at 42 U.S.C. 263a) requiring any laboratory that examines human specimens for the \npurpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or \nimpairment of, or the assessment of health, of human beings to be certified by the Secretary for \nthe categories of examinations or procedures performed by the laboratory.  The implementing \nregulations at 42 CFR part 493 specify the conditions and standards that must be met to achieve \nand maintain CLIA certification.  These conditions and standards strengthen federal oversight of \nclinical laboratories and help ensure the accuracy and reliability of patient test results. \nCurrently, the CLIA program only collects non-waived testing specialty and subspecialty \ninformation from laboratories issued a Certificate of Compliance (CoC), Certificate of \nAccreditation (CoA), or Certificate of Registration (CoR).  Such information is collected for \ncertain specialties, subspecialties, and analytes for proficiency testing purposes and during \nsurveys to ensure that the laboratory is meeting CLIA requirements for the level and \nspecialty/subspecialty of testing performed.

During this PHE for COVID-19, the \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing Emergency Use Authorizations for in vitro \ndiagnostics that are categorized to be run by certain CLIA-certified laboratories (which may \ninclude laboratories with a CoW or Certificate for PPM), depending on the scope and FDA\u2019s \ncategorization of the authorized test. SARS-CoV-2 testing includes molecular, antibody, and \nantigen methods.  Molecular (RT-PCR) tests detect the virus\u2019s genetic material and antigen tests \ndetect specific proteins on the surface of the virus.  Both types of tests are used to detect active or \nacute infection with SARS-CoV-2.  Serology (antibody) testing is used to look for the presence \nof antibodies which are proteins produced by the body in response to infections.  Due to the \nvariety of COVID-19 testing available, our current informational limitations present a gap in \nunderstanding the universe of laboratories performing SARS-CoV-2 testing.  \nWe believe that, by collecting testing information, the CLIA program will be able to \nidentify quality and accuracy issues with laboratories performing SARS-CoV-2 testing during \nthis PHE for COVID-19.

For CMS to ensure laboratories are reporting SARS-CoV-2 test results, the \nCLIA regulations need to be modified to require SARS-CoV-2 test result reporting. In the \ninterest of ensuring quality laboratory testing during the PHE for COVID-19, we are finalizing \nthe requirement for submission of SARS-CoV-2 test results to the Secretary.  Specifically, we \nare finalizing that during the PHE for COVID-19, as defined in \u00a7 400.200, each laboratory that \nperforms a SARS-CoV-2 test must report SARS-CoV-2 test results in such form and manner, \nand at such timing and frequency, as the Secretary may prescribe.  We are also finalizing that \nfailure to submit SARS-CoV-2 test results to the Secretary will be considered a violation of the \nnew CLIA reporting requirements, resulting in condition level deficiencies for which CMPs or \nother penalties may apply.  \nThese regulatory amendments at \u00a7\u00a7 493.41 and 493.1100(a) will require all laboratories, \nincluding, those holding a CoW, to report SARS-CoV-2 test results to the Secretary for the \nduration of the PHE for COVID-19, and specify that failure to do so will result in a condition \nlevel violation of the CLIA regulations.  Should a laboratory not report required SARS-CoV-2 \ntest results, we will impose a CMP under \u00a7\u00a7 493.1804 and 493.1834. \nWe are adding or amending the following regulations: \n\u25cf  At \u00a7 493.2, Definitions, we are amending the definition of \u201cCondition level \nrequirements\u201d to include the requirements in \u00a7 493.41.

Quality Reporting: Updates to the Extraordinary Circumstances Exceptions (ECE) Granted \nfor Four Value-Based Purchasing Programs in Response to the PHE for COVID-19, and Update \nto the Performance Period for the FY 2022 SNF VBP Program \nAs part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 22, 2020, we granted \nECEs to ESRD facilities, hospitals, and SNFs to reduce the data collection and reporting burden \non these facilities and providers so they could direct their full resources to patient care during the \nearly months of the pandemic.  Each of these ECEs relieved these providers and facilities of their \nobligation to report data for the fourth quarter calendar year (CY) 2019, first quarter CY 2020 \nand second quarter CY 2020, but we stated that we would score such data if optionally reported.   \nWe continue to believe that the data we have excepted from mandatory reporting under \nthese ECEs serves multiple purposes, including allowing us to understand the impact of the PHE \nfor COVID-19 on quality of care.

Updates to ESRD QIP:  Utilization of Fourth Quarter CY 2019 ESRD QIP Data and the \nRemoval of the Option for Facilities to Opt-Out of the Extraordinary Circumstances Exception \n(ECE) Granted With Respect to First and Second Quarter (CY) 2020 ESRD QIP Data  \na.  Background of the ESRD QIP ECE Policy \nThe ESRD QIP is authorized under section 1881(h) of the Act, and it aims to promote \nhigh-quality care in dialysis facilities by linking a portion of their payment under the ESRD \nprospective payment system (PPS) directly to their performance on quality of care measures.  \nThe ESRD QIP assesses facility performance on clinical and reporting measures adopted through \nthe rulemaking process and scores dialysis facilities based on that performance.  A facility that \ndoes not meet or exceed the minimum total performance score (TPS) set by CMS for the \napplicable payment year receives up to a 2 percent reduction to its ESRD PPS payment for that \nyear.\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            The ESRD QIP assesses facility performance on clinical and reporting measures adopted through the rulemaking process and scores dialysis facilities based on that performance .

It is for internal government use only \nand must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information.  Unauthorized \ndisclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. \nIn the CY 2015 ESRD PPS final rule (79 FR 66189 through 66190), we adopted an ECE \npolicy for the ESRD QIP, which recognized that there are times when facilities are unable to \nsubmit required quality data due to extraordinary circumstances that are not within their control, \nand that facilities should not be penalized for such circumstances or have their burden unduly \nincrease during these times.  This policy was implemented under the authority of section \n1881(h)(3)(A)(i) of the Act, which requires the Secretary to develop a methodology for assessing \nthe total performance of each provider of services and renal dialysis facility based on \nperformance standards for the measures selected under section 1881(h)(2) of the Act for a \nperformance period established under section 1881(h)(4)(D) of the Act.  We interpreted section \n1881(h)(3)(A)(i) of the Act to enable us to configure the methodology for assessing facilities' \ntotal performance such that we would not require a facility to submit, nor penalize a facility for \nfailing to submit, data on any ESRD QIP quality measure data from any month in which a \nfacility is granted an ECE. \nIn the CY 2018 ESRD PPS final rule (82 FR 50761 through 50763), we modified the \nrequirements for the ESRD QIP\u2019s ECE policy to further align that policy with the ECE policy \nadopted by other quality reporting and VBP programs.  In the CY 2020 ESRD PPS final rule (84 \nFR 60714), we codified requirements for the ECE policy at 42 CFR 413.178(d)(3) through (7), \nincluding a new option for facilities to reject an ECE granted by CMS under certain \ncircumstances.  We stated that this option would provide facilities with flexibility under the ECE \npolicy.  We also adopted this provision to provide further guidance to the public on the scope of \nour ECE policy. \nb.

Accordingly, we are updating our regulations at \u00a7 413.178(d)(7) to state that \na facility has opted out of the ECE for COVID-19 with respect to the reporting of fourth quarter \n2019 NHSN data if the facility actually reported the data by the March 31, 2020 submission \ndeadline but did not notify CMS that it would do so, and we will include these data when we \ncalculate facility TPSs for PY 2021 and performance standards for PY 2023.  This change will \nenable us to use the data which, as we explain above, are reflective of facility performance and \nwere reported with the expectation that they would be used for scoring.  This change is also \nconsistent with our statement in the ECE announcement that we would score these data if they \nwere submitted.  A facility that did not timely report its fourth quarter 2019 NHSN BSI clinical \nmeasure and NHSN Dialysis Event reporting measure data will not be eligible to receive scores \non those measures for PY 2021.   \nii.  CY 2020 First and Second Quarter ESRD QIP Data \nUnder our current policy, facilities may opt out of the ECE we proactively granted in \nresponse to the PHE for COVID-19, and continue to report ESRD QIP data.  We implemented \nthis policy to give facilities flexibility to continue to report, in particular where a facility does not \nbelieve it has been impacted by the extraordinary circumstance(s).  We do not believe that is the \ncase here, as the PHE for COVID-19 is a nationwide PHE and an overwhelming majority of \nfacilities continue to be impacted by COVID-19.  For example, regardless of protocols in place\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 B-F 39: Not releasable to the public UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW:  This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential .

Furthermore, due to the national nature of this \nPHE for COVID-19, we believe performance scores for certain measures could be biased and not \nreflective of nationally comparable performance.  Similarly, we are concerned that there may be \nindirect and unintended consequences of calculating scores using potentially biased data that \nmay not reflect the facility\u2019s overall quality.  Due to facilities having the option to submit or not \nsubmit data for this period, the data may not provide a nationally comparable assessment of \nperformance. Thus, reporting bias is possible due to the voluntary submission of data; that is, a \nbias could be potentially introduced because only high performers and/or facilities not impacted \nor better resourced would choose to submit data, while impacted facilities and/or facilities with \nfewer resources would choose not to submit data.  This would affect comparisons between \nfacilities with different circumstances, and would not be in keeping with the program goal of \nnational comparison.  Therefore, we believe that it would be inappropriate to include data \nsubmitted regarding care provided during first and second quarter CY 2020 in our calculation of \na facility\u2019s TPS, which is used to determine each facility\u2019s payment adjustment.

For example, if we granted an ECE that excepted facilities from the \nrequirement to report data for 11 of the 12 months of a given performance period, we would \nconsider not scoring or applying payment adjustments for the associated ESRD QIP payment \nyear because data from the one non-excepted month may not be large enough to calculate \nreliable measure results for scoring purposes.

Updates to the Application of the HAC Reduction Program ECE Policy in Response to the \nPHE for COVID-19  \na.  Background of the HAC Reduction Program ECE Policy \nThe Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program (\u201cHAC Reduction Program\u201d) is \nauthorized under section 1886(p) of the Act and it aims to heighten awareness of HACs and \nreduce the number of incidences that occur through implementing the payment adjustments \nauthorized under such statute.  The HAC Reduction Program began affecting hospitals\u2019 \nMedicare payments with FY 2015 discharges (that is, October 1, 2014).  In the FY 2016 \nInpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS)/Long-term Care Hospitals (LTCH) PPS final rule\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 B-F 42 .

We noted that we considered the feasibility and \nimplications of excluding data for certain measures for a limited period of time from the \ncalculations of the hospital\u2019s measure results or Total HAC Score for the applicable performance \nperiod.  We expressed our aim to minimize data excluded from the program to allow affected \nhospitals to continue to participate in the HAC Reduction Program for a given year if these \nhospitals continue to meet applicable measure minimum threshold requirements.  We further \nobserved that section 1886(p)(4) of the Act permits the Secretary to determine the applicable \nperiod for HAC data collection, and we interpreted the statute to allow us to determine that the \nperiod not include times when hospitals may encounter extraordinary circumstances.  This policy \nwas similar to the ECE policy for the Hospital Inpatient QRP, as initially adopted in the FY 2012 \nIPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51651), and modified in the FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH PPS final \nrule (78 FR 50836) and the FY 2015 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (79 FR 50277). \nIn the FY 2016 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (80 FR 49580 through 49581), we also stated \nthat this policy would not preclude CMS from granting ECEs to hospitals that do not request \nthem if we determine at our discretion that a disaster or other extraordinary circumstance has \naffected an entire region or locale.  We noted that if CMS makes such a determination to grant an \nECE to hospitals in an affected region or locale, we will convey this decision through routine \ncommunication channels to hospitals, vendors, and QIOs, including, but not limited to, issuing \nmemos, emails, and notices on the QualityNet website.

Background of the HAC Reduction Program ECE Granted for the PHE for COVID-19 \nOn March 22, 2020, in response to COVID-19, we announced relief for clinicians, \nproviders, hospitals, and facilities participating in Medicare QRPs and VBP programs.17  On \nMarch 27, 2020, we published a supplemental guidance memorandum that described in more \ndetail the scope and duration of the ECEs we were granting under each Medicare QRP and VBP \nprogram.18   \nUnder the ECE granted to all eligible hospitals under the HAC Reduction Program, we \nstated that qualifying claims would be excluded from the measure calculations for the CMS \nPatient Safety Indicators (PSI) 90 during the periods January 1, 2020\u2013March 31, 2020 (Q1 2020) \nand April 1, 2020\u2013June 30, 2020 (Q2 2020).

Update to the HAC Reduction Program ECE Granted in Response to the PHE for COVID-19 \nWe continue to believe that the HAC Reduction Program data we have excepted serves \nmultiple purposes, including allowing us to understand the impact of the PHE for COVID-19 on \nquality of care.  Furthermore, the chart-abstracted measures in the HAC Reduction Program are \ncalculated based on data submitted to the CDC's NHSN.  We recognize that because the CDC \nuses the same data for epidemiological surveillance, hospitals may have reporting requirements \nwhich are not affected by our ECE (for example, state requirements).  We are also concerned \nwith the national comparability of these data due to the geographic differences of COVID-19 \nincidence rates and hospitalizations along with different impacts resulting from different state \nand local law and policy changes implemented in response to COVID-19.  \nFor data which hospitals optionally report, we believe that the exception granted for those \nprograms with data submission deadlines in April and May 2020 (that is, data from the fourth \nquarter of CY 2019) is distinct from the exceptions granted because data collected may be \ngreatly impacted by the response to COVID-19he (that is, data from the first and second quarters \nof CY 2020).\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 B-F 45: Not releasable to the public UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW:  This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential .

Unauthorized \ndisclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. \ni.  CY 2019 Fourth Quarter Data \nAs described previously, we excepted hospitals from the requirement to report fourth \nquarter CY 2019 data for the HAC Reduction Program to alleviate the reporting burden on \nhospitals that were responding to the PHE for COVID-19 during the May 18, 2020 data \nsubmission deadline.  However, nearly all hospitals (95.3 percent) reported these data by the \nsubmission deadline, which reflects care provided prior to January 27, 2020, which is the start of \nthe PHE for COVID-19 under the Secretary\u2019s declaration of a PHE under section 319 of the \nPHSA.  Therefore, we determined that it would be appropriate to include data that were \noptionally reported by hospitals for the fourth quarter of CY 2019 in calculating hospitals\u2019 Total \nHAC Scores, which are used to determine the worst-performing 25 percent of hospitals on HAC \nperformance for assessing the 1 percent HAC Reduction Program penalty.  This determination is \nconsistent with the policy stated in the March 27, 2020 guidance memo.19  \nii.  CY 2020 First and Second Quarter Data \nIn our application of the ECE policy for the PHE for COVID-19, we excepted hospitals \nfrom the requirement to report first and second quarter of CY 2020 HAC Reduction Program \nchart-abstracted measures and stated we would exclude qualifying claims both because we hoped \nto alleviate the reporting burden on hospitals that were responding to the PHE for COVID-19 \nand because of our concern that the representativeness of the data collected during this period \nmay be greatly impacted by the response to COVID-19.   \nWe also noted that if hospitals optionally chose to report data, we would use that data for \nprogram calculations.

We believe that using CY \n2020 optionally reported data may not provide a nationally comparable assessment of hospital \nperformance for multiple reasons.  First, allowing hospitals the option to voluntarily submit for \nthis period may introduce reporting bias; that is, a bias introduced because, for example, only \nhigh performers and/or hospitals not impacted or better resourced would choose to submit data, \nwhich would render comparisons between hospitals with different circumstances not in keeping \nwith the program goal of national comparison.  In addition, a number of other factors could also \ncontribute to our ability to accurately calculate a national comparison.  For example, geographic \ndifferences in COVID-19 incidence rates and COVID-19 related hospitalizations and differences \nresulting from changes in referral and hospitalization patterns could both impact the national \ncomparability of optionally submitted data.  Because the HAC Reduction Program relies on a \nrelative scoring methodology, we believe that it would be inappropriate and could disparately \nimpact hospitals to include data from quarters excepted under CMS guidance for the PHE for \nCOVID-19 in our calculation of hospitals\u2019 performance for the program.   \nFinally, although the ECE we granted for the HAC Reduction Program has ended, with \ndata collection and reporting requirements resuming July 1, 2020, we understand that geographic \ndifferences in COVID-19 incidence continue to change during the PHE for COVID-19.  To \nmaintain flexibility for addressing the impact of COVID-19 on the HAC Reduction Program and \ndetermine how best to implement the program equitably, we are announcing that if, as a result of \nthe extension of the ECE for the whole country that we grant without a request or the submission \nof individual ECE requests, we do not have enough HAC Reduction Program data to reliably \nmeasure national performance, we may propose to not score hospitals based on such limited data\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 B-F 47: Not releasable to the public UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW:  This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential .

If we grant another ECE in the future, we would not require that hospitals report the \nexcepted data for the duration of the ECE.  Although a hospital may voluntarily report data \nduring the ECE, we may determine that such data will not be used for scoring purposes.  We \nwould still require that hospitals report the non-excepted data.  However, we may determine that \nit would be inappropriate to score such data or base payment adjustments on it because of \nreliability concerns.  For illustrative purposes only, if a PHE excepted enough quarters from the \nHAC Reduction Program\u2019s 24-month performance period to lead to unreliable measure \ncalculations, we might consider not scoring for the fiscal year because the sample may not be \nlarge enough to calculate reliable measure results for scoring purposes.  Although the data itself \nmay be accurate, the measure(s) may not meet the reliability standards because of the small \nsample of the remaining non-excepted part of the performance period.  In addition, in the \nscenario we describe above, it is likely that only larger hospitals would be able to meet the \nrequired case minimums to be scored in the non-excepted part of the performance period.  We \nmay conclude that only scoring those remaining large hospitals will not produce an accurate \nnational comparison of hospitals.  Alternatively, if we do not extend the ECE to cover Q3 and \nQ4 2020, it is possible that a majority of providers may still submit individual ECE requests for \nthose quarters and it is possible that so many hospitals will submit individual ECE requests that \nwe will not be able to produce a reliable national comparison.

Update to the HRRP ECE Granted in Response to the PHE for COVID-19  \na.  Background of the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program ECE Policy \nIn the FY 2016 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (80 FR 49542 through 49543), we adopted an \nECE policy for the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, which recognized that there may \nbe periods of time during which a hospital is not able to submit all claims (from which \nreadmission measures data are derived) in an accurate or timely fashion due to an extraordinary \ncircumstance beyond its control.  We noted that we considered the feasibility and implications of \nexcluding data for certain measures for a limited period of time from the calculations for a \nhospital's excess readmissions ratios for the applicable performance period.  We expressed that \nwe hoped to minimize data excluded from the program to allow affected hospitals to continue to \nparticipate in the HRRP for a given year if these hospitals otherwise continue to meet applicable \nmeasure minimum threshold requirements.  We further observed that section 1886(q)(5)(D) of \nthe Act permits the Secretary to determine the applicable period for readmissions data collection, \nand we interpreted the statute to allow us to determine that the period not include times when \nhospitals may encounter extraordinary circumstances.

We also advised that hospitals should be aware of \nthe potential subsequent impact to the HRRP minimum case threshold counts for inclusion in this \nprogram.  \nc.  Update to the HRRP ECE Granted in Response to the PHE for COVID-19 \nWe continue to believe that the readmissions claims data we have excepted serve \nmultiple purposes, including allowing us to understand the impact of the PHE for COVID-19 on \nthe quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries.  However, we are concerned that excess \nreadmission ratios calculated using excepted claims data could affect the national comparability \nof these data due to the geographic differences of COVID-19 incidence rates and hospitalizations \nalong with different impacts resulting from different state and local law and policy changes \nimplemented in response to COVID-19.  Thus, the excess readmission ratios and payment \nadjustments calculated from excepted data during the PHE for COVID-19 may not provide a \nnationally comparable assessment of performance in keeping with the program goal of national \ncomparison.  \ni.  CY 2019 Fourth Quarter Data \nData were not excepted from the fourth quarter of CY 2019 from the HRRP.  The \nreadmissions measures used to evaluate performance are claims-based measures and do not \nrequire hospitals to report data to CMS.

Unauthorized \ndisclosure may result in prosecution to the full extent of the law. \nIn our application of the ECE policy for the PHE for COVID-19, we excepted the use of \nclaims data from the first and second quarters of CY 2020 from the HRRP because of our \nconcern that the data collected during this period may be greatly impacted by the response to \nCOVID-19, and therefore, may not be reflective of a hospital\u2019s performance during this time due \nto concerns with national comparability, as described above.  Therefore, we believe that it would \nbe inappropriate to include claims data submitted regarding care provided during first and second \nquarter CY 2020 in our calculation of a hospital\u2019s performance that assesses their performance as \ncompared to other hospitals in the nation to determine penalties for excess readmissions.   \nFinally, although the ECE we granted for HRRP has ended, with data collection and \nreporting requirements having resumed July 1, 2020, we understand that geographic differences \nin COVID-19 incidence continue to change during the PHE for COVID-19.

If we grant \nanother ECE in the future, we would not require that hospitals report the excepted data for the \nduration of the ECE.

We may conclude that only scoring those remaining large hospitals will produce an \naccurate national comparison of hospitals.  Alternatively, if we do not extend the ECE to cover \nQ3 and Q4 2020, it is possible that a majority of providers may still submit individual ECE \nrequests for those quarters and it is possible that so many hospitals will submit individual ECE \nrequests that we will not be able to produce a reliable national comparison.

Background of the Hospital VBP ECE Policy \nIn the FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH final rule (78 FR 50704 through 50707), we finalized a \ndisaster/ECE policy for the Hospital VBP Program.  We stated that, upon a hospital\u2019s request, we \nwill consider providing an exception from the Hospital VBP Program requirements to hospitals \naffected by natural disasters or other extraordinary circumstances (78 FR 50704 through 50706). \nSpecifically, we stated that we interpreted the minimum number of cases and measures \nrequirement in sections 1886(o)(1)(C)(ii)(III) and (IV) of the Act to not include any measures or \ncases for which a hospital has submitted data during a performance period for which the hospital \nhas been granted a Hospital VBP Program ECE.  \nIn the May 8th COVID-19 IFC (85 FR 27550), we modified the Hospital VBP Program\u2019s \nECE policy to allow us to grant ECE exceptions to hospitals which have not requested them \nwhen we determine that an extraordinary circumstance that is out of their control, such as an act \nof nature (for example, a hurricane) or PHE (for example, the COVID-19 pandemic), affects an \nentire region or locale, in addition to retaining the individual ECE request policy (85 FR 27597 \nthrough 27598).  We stated that if we grant an ECE to hospitals located in an entire region or \nlocale under this revised policy and, as a result of granting that ECE, one or more hospitals \nlocated in that region or locale does not report the minimum number of cases and measures \nrequired to enable us to calculate a TPS for that hospital for the applicable program year, the \nhospital will be excluded from the Hospital VBP Program for the applicable program year.  We \nalso stated that a hospital that does not report the minimum number of cases or measures for a \nprogram year will not receive a 2 percent reduction to its base operating diagnosis-related group \n(DRG) payment amount for each discharge in the applicable program year, and will also not be \neligible to receive any value-based incentive payments for the applicable program year.

Update to the Hospital VBP ECE Granted in Response to the PHE for COVID-19 \n We continue to believe that the Hospital VBP Program data we have excepted serves \nmultiple purposes, including allowing us to understand the impact of COVID-19 on quality of \ncare.  Furthermore, the HAI measures in the Hospital VBP Program are not abstracted from \nclaims and are calculated based on data submitted to the CDC through the NHSN.  We recognize \nthat the CDC separately collects the same data for epidemiological surveillance and that \nhospitals may have other reporting requirements which are not affected by our ECE (for \nexample, state requirements).  We are concerned with the national comparability of these data \ndue to the geographic differences of COVID-19 incidence rates and hospitalizations along with \ndifferent impacts resulting from different state and local law and policy changes implemented in \nresponse to COVID-19.  For these reasons, and as discussed more fully below, we are revising \nthe current ECE we granted for the Hospital VBP Program with respect to first and second \nquarter CY 2020 excepted data.  Under the revised ECE, we will not use any first or second \nquarter CY 2020 excepted Hospital VBP data that hospitals optionally reported to calculate total \nperformance scores for the FY 2022 through FY 2025 program years or baseline scores for the \nFY 2024 through FY 2030 program years.

CY 2019 Fourth Quarter Hospital VBP Program HAI and HCAHPS Data \nWe excepted hospitals from the requirement to report fourth quarter CY 2019 HAI and \nHCAHPS data for the HVBP Program to alleviate the reporting burden on hospitals that were \nresponding to the PHE for COVID-19 that would otherwise be required to report these data by \nthe May 18, 2020 and April 1, 2020 submission deadlines, respectively.  However, we believe \nthat the quality measure data regarding care provided prior to the PHE for COVID-19 would not \nbe affected.  Additionally, as of April 2020, 92.6 percent of hospitals submitted fourth quarter \nCY 2019 HAI data.  Therefore, we are not making changes to the Hospital VBP Program ECE \nthat we granted with respect to these data for the PHE for COVID-19 and will include all \nvoluntarily reported measure data for the HCAHPS survey and the five NHSN HAI measures \nwhen we calculate hospital TPSs for the FY 2021 program year, as well as when we calculate \nbaseline data for the FY 2023 program year.  Because we did not except fourth quarter CY 2019 \nclaims-based data for the Hospital VBP Program, we will also include those data when we \ncalculate hospital TPSs for the FY 2021 through FY 2024 program years and baseline data for \nthe FY 2026 through FY 2029 program years.  \nii.

Although we \npermitted hospitals to voluntarily report these data, we aim to have the most representative \ncomparison of hospital performance as possible and do not wish to unfairly penalize hospitals \nthat were responding to COVID-19.  We believe that using first and second quarter CY 2020 \noptionally reported data may not provide an accurate national assessment of hospital \nperformance for multiple reasons.  First, if only the optionally submitted data is used, it may not \nprovide an accurate national comparison as it is possible that there may be reporting bias \nintroduced by voluntary submission.  Reporting bias could be introduced if, for example, only \nhigh performers and/or hospitals not impacted or better resourced would choose to submit data, \nhindering comparisons between hospitals with different circumstances and preventing the \nprogram from keeping with its goal of national comparison.  A number of other factors could \nalso contribute to CMS\u2019 ability to generate an accurate national comparison.  For example, \ngeographic differences in COVID-19 incidence rates and COVID-19 related hospitalizations and \ndifferences resulting from changes in referral and hospitalization patterns could both impact the \nnational comparability of optionally submitted data.  We believe that it would be inappropriate to \ninclude optionally submitted data regarding care provided during first and second quarter CY \n2020 in our calculation of a hospital\u2019s TPS.  \nAccordingly, for these reasons, we will not use any first or second quarter CY 2020 \nexcepted Hospital VBP data to calculate total performance scores for the FY 2022 through FY \n2025 program years or baseline scores for the FY 2024 through FY 2030 program years to avoid \nunfairly penalizing hospitals.\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 B-F 59 is for internal government use only  and must not be disseminated, distributed, or copied to persons not authorized to receive the information .

To maintain flexibility for addressing the impact of COVID-19 on the Hospital VBP \nProgram and determine how best to implement the program equitably, we are announcing in this \nIFC  that if, as a result of the extension of the ECE for the whole country that we grant without a \nrequest or the submission of individual ECE requests, we do not have enough data to reliably \nmeasure national performance, we may propose to not score hospitals based on such limited data \nor make the associated payment adjustments to facilities under the Hospital VBP Program for the \naffected program year.  If we grant another ECE in the future, we would not require that \nhospitals report the excepted data for the duration of the ECE.  Although a hospital may \nvoluntarily report data during the ECE, we may determine that it would be inappropriate to use \nsuch data for scoring purposes.  We would still require that hospitals report the non-excepted \ndata.  However, we may determine that it would be inappropriate to score such data or base \npayment adjustments on it because of reliability concerns.  For example, if we granted an ECE \nthat excepted hospitals from the requirement to report data for 11 of the 12 months of a given \nperformance period, we would consider not scoring or applying payment adjustments for the \nassociated program year because data from the one non-excepted month may not be large enough \nto calculate reliable measure results.  Although the data itself may be accurate, the measure(s) \nmay not meet the reliability standards because of the small sample of the remaining non-\nexcepted part of the performance period.  In addition, in the scenario we describe above, it is \nplausible that only larger hospitals would be able to meet the required case minimums to be \nscored in the non-excepted part of the performance period.  We may conclude that only scoring\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            The ECE we granted for the Hospital VBP Program has ended has ended, with data collection and reporting requirements having resumed July 1, 2020 .

Background of the SNF VBP ECE Policy \nIn the FY 2019 SNF PPS final rule (83 FR 39280 through 39281), we finalized an ECE \npolicy for the SNF VBP Program.  We stated that a SNF requesting an ECE would indicate the \ndates and duration of the extraordinary circumstance in its request, along with any available \nevidence of the extraordinary circumstance, and if approved, we would exclude the \ncorresponding calendar months from that SNF\u2019s measure rate for the applicable measurement \nperiod and by extension, its SNF performance score for applicable fiscal years.  We noted that \nthis policy does not preclude us from granting exceptions to SNFs that have not requested them \nwhen we determine that an extraordinary circumstance, such as an act of nature or PHE, affects \nan entire region or locale. \nWe also finalized under the SNF VBP Program ECE policy that we would score any \nSNFs receiving ECEs on achievement and improvement for any remaining months during the \nperformance period, provided the SNF had at least 25 eligible stays during both of those periods.  \nAs an example, we stated that if a SNF received an approved ECE for 6 months of the \nperformance period, we would score the SNF on its achievement during the remaining 6 months \non the Program\u2019s measure as long as the SNF met the 25 eligible stay threshold during the \nperformance period.  We also stated that under this example, we would score the SNF on \nimprovement as long as it met the proposed 25 eligible stay threshold during the applicable \nbaseline period. \nb.

Revised Performance Period for the FY 2022 SNF VBP Program  \nThe performance period for the FY 2022 SNF VBP Program is FY 2020 (84 FR 38822). \nThe ECE for the PHE for COVID-19 excepts 6 months of claims data from the calculation of the \nSNFRM during the performance period of the FY 2022 SNF VBP Program.  \nWe are concerned that using qualifying claims during only the remaining 6 months of FY \n2020 (October 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 (Q4 2019), and July 1, 2020 through \nSeptember 30, 2020 (Q3 2020)) for all SNFs nationwide to calculate the SNFRM for the FY \n2022 Program will not yield measure scores that reliably reflect quality of care as determined by \nhospital readmission rates because the reliability of the SNFRM rate is related to sample size.  \nWe distinguish between ECEs that grant exceptions for a limited number of SNFs on a case-by-\ncase basis (that is, if a SNF submits an ECE form with appropriate supporting evidence), which \nwould yield an acceptable reflection of those SNFs\u2019 performance, and blanket ECEs that grant \nexceptions for all SNFs nationwide, which may decrease the likelihood that measure \nperformance would reflect the quality of care across a large number of SNFs.  Furthermore, the \nNQF endorsed the SNFRM as a one-year measure.26  In line with NQF endorsement, the \nperformance period and baseline period SNFRM rate for a program year has been calculated \nbased on one year of data since the Program\u2019s inception.  Our internal analysis indicates that \ncalculating the SNFRM based on 6 months data for all SNFs nationwide would decrease the \nSNFRM\u2019s reliability by approximately one-third compared to calculating the SNFRM based on \none year of data, resulting in unacceptably low measure reliability.  This situation differs from, \nfor example, calculating the SNFRM based on 6-months of data for only several SNFs, which \n \n26 From https://www.qualityforum.org/Measures_Reports_Tools.aspx, click \u201cNQF-Endorsed Measures (QPS)\u201d \nunder \u201cFind Measures\u201d then search \u201c2510\u201d to view the SNFRM.\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            The performance period for the FY 2022 SNF VBP Program is FY 2020 (84 FR 38822) The ECE for the PHE for COVID-19 excepts 6 months of claims data from the calculation of the SNFRM during the performance period of the . performance period .

Therefore, we are revising the performance period for the FY \n2022 SNF VBP Program.  The revised performance period for the FY 2022 SNF VBP program \nwill include data from: April 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 and July 1, 2020 through \nSeptember 30, 2020.  We note that this 12-month period includes 6 months of FY 2019 data and \n6 months FY 2020 data, but does not include the 6 months of data that we excepted for the SNF \nVBP Program under the ECE for the PHE for COVID-19.  Eligible SNF stays with admissions \nduring this revised 12-month period, April 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 and July 1, 2020 \nthrough September 30, 2020, will be included in performance period SNFRM calculations for \nthe FY 2022 SNF VBP Program.  We believe using data from these two periods, which \ncombines 9 months of data prior to the start of the PHE for COVID-19 and 3 months of data \nafter the end of the ECE we granted for this program, will provide sufficiently reliable data for \nevaluating SNF performance that can be used for FY 2022 scoring.  We selected this \nperformance period data as it was the most operationally feasible, did not use data from FY 2018 \n(the baseline period for the SNF VBP FY 2022 program year), and provided the least overlap \nwith performance periods for other program years.    \nWe are aware that the revised performance period for the FY 2022 Program overlaps with \nthe performance period of the FY 2021 Program (FY 2019) by 6 months.

NCD Procedural Volumes for Facilities and Practitioners to Maintain Medicare Coverage \nNational Coverage Determinations (NCDs) are determinations by the Secretary with \nrespect to whether or not a particular item or service is covered nationally under title XVIII of \nthe Act.

Limits on COVID-19 and Related Testing without an Order and Expansion of Testing Order \nAuthority   \nIn this IFC, we are establishing that one COVID-19 diagnostic test and one of each other \nrelated test (as listed in the May 8th COVID-19 IFC) without an order from a physician or other \npractitioner is reasonable and necessary for Medicare payment purposes. For the COVID-19 and \nother related diagnostic tests for which an order is required, we are also establishing a policy \nwhereby tests can be covered when ordered by a pharmacist or other healthcare professional who \nis authorized to order diagnostic laboratory tests in accordance with state scope of practice and \nother pertinent laws.  \nIn the May 8th COVID-19 IFC, CMS stated that, given the critical importance of \nexpanding COVID-19 testing to combat the pandemic and the heightened risk that the disease \npresents to Medicare beneficiaries during the PHE for COVID-19, Medicare would not require \nan order from a physician or other applicable practitioner for COVID-19 testing.  We amended \nour regulation at 42 CFR 410.32(a) to remove the requirement that otherwise covered COVID-19 \ndiagnostic laboratory tests are covered only based on the order of a treating physician or other \npractitioner.29  In addition, we removed the ordering requirement for coverage of a diagnostic \nlaboratory test for influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, a type of common respiratory \nvirus, but only when these tests are furnished in conjunction with a COVID-19 diagnostic \nlaboratory test as medically necessary in the course of establishing or ruling out a COVID-19 \ndiagnosis.  We also noted that FDA-authorized COVID-19 serology tests are included as covered \ntests during the PHE for COVID-19, as they are reasonable and necessary under section \n \n29 The list of COVID-19, Influenza, and RSV clinical diagnostic laboratory tests is available at \nhttps://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-ifc-2-flu-rsv-codes.pdf.\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB  08/24/20 B-H 71: Not released to the public unless authorized by law .

This \nlimitation on tests without a physician/other practitioner order will apply beginning on the \neffective date of this rule, and any tests furnished prior to the effective date will not be \nconsidered for purposes of this limit on tests without a physician or other practitioner order.  In \nother words, if a beneficiary received a test or multiple tests without an order before the effective \ndate of this rule, these tests would not count toward the limit of one test without a physician or \nother practitioner order under this rule.  We believe that this approach will provide sufficient \nnotice for laboratories to set up the systems and processes necessary to require an order beyond \none test. For the COVID-19 and other related diagnostic tests for which an order is required, we \nare also establishing a policy whereby the tests can be covered when ordered by a pharmacist or \nother healthcare professional who is authorized to order diagnostic laboratory tests in accordance \nwith state scope of practice and other pertinent laws.   \nJust as the previous policy was developed based on what was known about COVID-19 at \nthe time, as additional information has become available, policies require modification.  This \napproach is consistent with the CDC\u2019s introductory statement in its July 2, 2020 testing guidance \nthat \u201crecommendations for SARS-CoV-2 testing have been developed based on what is currently \nknown about COVID-19 and are subject to change as additional information becomes\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            Previously policy allowed for broad coverage of multiple instances of COVID-19 testing for a single beneficiary without a physician or other practitioner order .

Our determination to \nrevise the May 8th IFC policy is due both to the significant potential for fraud, waste, and abuse, \nas well as public health and safety issues that would arise from beneficiaries being subjected to \nrepeated testing without proper medical attention or oversight, including public health issues \nwith the ongoing spread of COVID-19, as outlined by CDC guidance on specific patient \ncategories31  that has been published in the May 8th COVID-19 IFC.     \nFirst, laboratory testing has been a significant source of fraud and abuse in the Medicare \nprogram.  In one recent example from September 2019, CMS, along with our law enforcement \npartners, undertook a landmark investigation and prosecution of fraudulent genetic cancer \ntesting, resulting in charges against 35 defendants associated with dozens of telemedicine \ncompanies and cancer genetic testing laboratories for their alleged participation in one of the \nlargest healthcare fraud schemes ever charged.  According to the charges, the defendants \nfraudulently billed Medicare for genetic testing, using telemarketers to make phone calls and \nother unsolicited contacts with Medicare beneficiaries to fraudulently bill more than $2.1 billion \nto the Medicare program..32  \nWe have already found that similar schemes are occurring whereby fraudulent \nlaboratories and telemarketing companies are directly contacting beneficiaries, oftentimes using \nstolen identifying information, to solicit items and services payable by Medicare under the guise \n \n30 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html. \n31 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html. \n32 https://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/media-materials/2019/geneticscam/index.asp.\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB  08/24/20 B-H 73: Not releasable to the public unless authorized to receive the information .

An HHS Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) fraud \nalert33 describes situations in which scammers are offering unapproved and illegitimate COVID-\n19 tests and other services to Medicare beneficiaries in exchange for personal details, including \nMedicare information.  However, the services are unapproved and illegitimate. Fraudsters are \ntargeting beneficiaries in a number of ways, including telemarketing calls, text messages, social \nmedia platforms, and door-to-door visits.  The personal information collected can be used to \nfraudulently bill federal healthcare programs and commit medical identity theft.  In addition, if \nMedicare denies the claim for an unapproved test, the beneficiary could be responsible for the \ncost.  The availability of broad COVID-19 and related testing without an order significantly \nincreases the risk and scope of these fraud schemes, leading not only to considerable risk to \ntaxpayer dollars, but also potential physical and financial harm to Medicare beneficiaries.   \nIn addition to our concerns about previous laboratory schemes being applied to COVID-\n19 testing itself, the risk is exacerbated by the ability of the laboratory to perform add-on tests, \nsuch as to confirm or rule-out diagnoses other than COVID-19.  The HHS-OIG has recognized \nthat \u201c[r]elaxation of the [ordering] rules could allow unscrupulous actors more leeway for \nfraudulent billing of unnecessary add-on testing,\u201d and announced in June 2020 that it was \nundertaking a trend analysis for potential fraud and abuse with COVID-19 add-on testing.34   \nIn addition to our concerns about potential fraud, we believe that broad COVID-19 \ntesting without the order of any healthcare professional\u2014including testing for the related \nconditions identified in the May 8th COVID-19 IFC\u2014may result in a beneficiary not receiving \nthe medical attention and oversight required to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is applied \n \n33 https://oig.hhs.gov/coronavirus/fraud-alert-covid19.asp. \n34 https://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/workplan/summary/wp-summary-0000489.asp.\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            An HHS Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) fraud alert describes situations in which scammers are offering unapproved and illegitimate tests and other services to Medicare beneficiaries in exchange for personal details .

Allowing testing to occur without \nproper medical attention or oversight can lead to direct or indirect harm to beneficiaries, their \nfamilies and their contacts, from a variety of perspectives, including the fact that the beneficiary \nmay not receive complete and accurate information on how the test results should be interpreted \nand acted upon (for example, contact tracing and public health precautions) and how the \nbeneficiary should be monitored in the case of a positive test.  \nOf the nearly 1.9 million beneficiaries who have been tested, approximately 83 percent \nhave had only one test performed.  However, claims data from the past 8 months have shown \nthat the number of beneficiaries receiving more than one COVID-19 test has been increasing. \nWhile we do not have data to examine whether these tests are being performed without a \nphysician or other practitioner order, we expect the proportion of beneficiaries who are tested \nmore than once to increase over time until a vaccine or other containment strategy is available to \nmeaningfully reduce the risk of COVID-19.  We believe that allowing Medicare payment for one \ntest without an order will allow beneficiaries access to urgent testing, as we outlined in the May \n8th COVID-19 IFC, yet also provide sufficient opportunity for beneficiaries to seek out the \nmedical care needed to ensure that the test results are interpreted and acted upon appropriately, \nboth from the perspective of the individual beneficiary and also in the context of the area of the \ncountry in which the beneficiary is located.  \nWhile some areas of the country continue to have minimal impact from the disease or are \nseeing the COVID-19 infection curve flattening, other areas are seeing a resurgence.

Testing without healthcare oversight can lead to a bypassing of risk-stratified protocols for \nmanagement of negative COVID-19 test results.  A negative test does not rule out the disease; if \na physician or other appropriate healthcare professional suspects a patient may have COVID-19 \nbased on symptoms or other factors, infection control measures should be implemented \nregardless of test results.  For example, isolation of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2, the \nvirus that causes COVID-19, is a key strategy for preventing further spread of COVID-19.  In \nfact, when infected individuals are separated from others while awaiting their test results, \ntransmission is reduced much more than when individuals are not separated. By having patients \nisolated one to two days earlier, spread of COVID-19 can be reduced significantly.35  When a \nphysician or other health care provider is able to counsel patients who are being tested for \nCOVID-19, beneficiaries may be more likely to isolate or quarantine themselves more quickly, \nwhich may reduce transmission in the community.  Self-quarantine for those who may be \ninfectious is also a key element to ensuring that health care providers and suppliers are able to \ncontinue to safely provide COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19 essential care, patients can \nresume elective procedures, and that the nation can continue steps to reopen the economy.  \nWe remain committed to ensuring beneficiaries have access to needed testing services, \nand to the medical oversight required to address this complex pandemic.

The telehealth and CTBS flexibilities have provided a modernized framework for \ncare delivery, including the ability for clinicians to remotely assess the medical condition of \npatients and determine the need for COVID-19 testing and perform related clinical oversight, \nwhich takes advantage of modern technology while addressing the health needs of the Medicare \nbeneficiary population.  \nIn addition, in our March 31st COVID-19 IFC, we established payment policies to \nprovide specimen collection fees for independent laboratories collecting specimens from \nbeneficiaries who are homebound or non-hospital inpatients for COVID-19 testing during the \nPHE for COVID-19.  In our May 8th COVID-19 IFC, we also established payment mechanisms \nfor specimen collection for COVID-19 testing under the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) and \nOPPS during the PHE for COVID-19.  To help ensure that laboratories located in the United \nStates wishing to perform COVID-19 testing that are applying for a CLIA certificate are able to \nbegin testing as quickly as possible during the PHE for COVID-19, we have also reviewed our \nregulations (42 CFR part 493) and our procedures to expedite review of applications for a CLIA \ncertificate.  We are committed to taking critical steps to ensure Medicare beneficiaries are able to \naccess safe and reliable COVID-19 and related testing. \nCMS and CDC are also taking steps to ensure that physicians and other practitioners who \ncounsel patients on COVID-19 testing are paid for these services.

Calculation of Plan Average Premium and State Average Premium under the Federally-\ncertified Risk Adjustment Methodology (\u00a7 153.320)  \nThe HHS risk adjustment methodology applicable to the 2020 benefit year includes the \nstate payment transfer formula and the high-cost risk pool parameters.49  The state payment \ntransfer formula includes a set of cost adjustment terms that require transfers to be calculated at \nthe geographic rating area level for each plan (that is, we calculate separate transfer amounts for \neach rating area in which a risk adjustment covered plan operates).  It also includes a 14 percent \nadministrative cost reduction to the statewide average premium.  The state payment transfer \nformula generally calculates the difference between the revenues required by a plan, based on the \nhealth risk of the plan\u2019s enrollees, and the revenues that the plan can generate for those enrollees. \nThese differences are then compared across plans in the state market risk pool50 and converted to \na dollar amount based on the statewide average premium.  The difference between the two \npremium estimates determines whether a plan pays a risk adjustment charge or receives a risk \nadjustment payment.51   \n \n46 See section 1321(c)(1) of the PPACA.  Also see 45 CFR 153.310(a). \n47 See the 2020 Payment Notice final rule, 84 FR at 17463 (April 25, 2019).  \n48 Ibid. \n49 See the 2020 Payment Notice final rule, 84 FR at 17466 through 17468 and 17480 through 17486. \n50 Risk adjustment transfer under the state payment transfer formula are calculated at the risk pool level, and \ncatastrophic plans are treated as a separate risk pool for purpose of these calculations.   \n51 The value of the plan average risk score by itself does not determine whether a plan would be assessed a charge or \nreceive a payment \u2013 even if the risk score is greater than 1.0, it is possible that the plan would be assessed a charge if \nthe premium compensation that the plan may receive through its rating (as measured through the allowable rating \nfactor) exceeds the plan\u2019s predicated liability associated with risk selection.\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            HHS did not receive any requests from states seeking to operate their own risk adjustment program for the 2020 benefit year .

This \nresulting PMPM plan payment or charge is multiplied by the number of billable member months \nto determine the plan payment or charge based on plan liability risk scores for a plan\u2019s \ngeographic rating area for the applicable state market risk pool.  The payment or charge under \nthe state payment transfer formula is thus calculated to balance the state market risk pool in \nquestion. \nIn prior rulemaking,53 CMS finalized the calculation of plan average premium as equal to \nthe actual premiums charged to plan enrollees, weighted by the number of months enrolled, and \nfinalized the calculation of the state average premium as equal to the average of individual plan \naverage premiums, weighted by each plan\u2019s share of statewide enrollment in the risk pool \nmarket, based on billable member months.   \nThis IFC sets forth how HHS will treat temporary premium credits provided for purposes \nof applying the state payment transfer formula for the 2020 benefit year.54  For states where \nissuers of risk adjustment covered plans have provided temporary premium credits, the plan \naverage premium and statewide average premium used in the state payment transfer formula will \n \n52 See the 2020 Payment Notice final rule for further details on other reasons why statewide average premium is the \ncost-scaling factor in the state payment transfer formula.

We clarify that HHS will use adjusted plan premiums for all enrollees whom the issuer \nhas actually provided premium credits as a reduction to 2020 benefit year premiums, even if the \ncredits were not provided in a manner consistent with the August 4, 2020 memo, when \ncalculating transfers under the state payment transfer formula for the 2020 benefit year.  As \ndetailed further below, issuers providing these temporary premium credits must report the lower, \nactual premium amounts billed to plan enrollees to their respective EDGE servers.  We believe \nthat the applicable definitions of plan average premium and state average premium retain the \nmeaning previously finalized by reflecting the actual monthly premium billed to enrollees.  In \naddition, the recognition of temporary premium credits for 2020 coverage as a reduction in \npremium for purposes of the risk adjustment program is a necessary and appropriate step to align \nrisk adjustment charges and payments under the state payment transfer formula with the \nflexibilities provided to issuers and states elsewhere in this rulemaking to respond to the PHE for \nCOVID-19.  This approach also provides necessary clarity to issuers as they evaluate whether \nand in what amount to offer premium relief to enrollees to assist those adversely affected \nfinancially by the PHE for COVID-19 to maintain continuous health insurance coverage.

We clarify in this IFC that, \nfor purposes of 2020 benefit year data submissions,59 the subscriber-level premium information \nthat issuers upload to their EDGE servers must reflect the adjusted (that is, lower) monthly \npremium reflecting the amounts actually billed to their enrollees, inclusive of any premium \ncredits provided.  We clarify in this IFC that CMS will require issuers to submit adjusted plan \npremiums to their EDGE servers for all enrollees whom the issuer has actually provided \npremium credits as a reduction to 2020 benefit year premiums, even if these premium credits \nwere not provided in a manner consistent with the August 4, 2020 memo.  Issuers should \ncontinue to submit the full, unadjusted premium amounts for any coverage for which they did not \nprovide temporary premium credits.  This IFC does not change any other aspect of the 2020 \nbenefit year data submission requirements for the HHS-operated risk adjustment program.

Section 158.130 specifies the reporting requirements with regard to \nearned premium, which must include all monies paid by a policyholder or subscriber as a \ncondition of receiving coverage from the issuer, with certain adjustments. \nThis IFC sets forth how CMS will treat temporary premium credits for purposes of MLR \nreporting and rebate requirements of these amounts for 2020 coverage.61  During 2020, a number \nof issuers are expected to provide premium relief to enrollees, which will result in policyholders \nand subscribers paying a reduced amount of premium for coverage in 2020 in the months for \nwhich the credits are provided.  The recognition of temporary premium credits as a reduction in \npremium for purposes of the MLR program is a necessary and appropriate step to align MLR \ncalculations with the flexibilities provided to issuers and states elsewhere in this rulemaking to \nrespond to the PHE for COVID-19.  This approach also provides necessary clarity to issuers as \nthey evaluate whether and in what amount to offer temporary premium credits to assist enrollees \nin maintaining continuous health insurance coverage during the PHE for COVID-19. \nTo ensure that an issuer\u2019s MLR accurately reflects the amounts actually billed to their \nenrollees as the issuer\u2019s premium revenue, we clarify that for purposes of \u00a7 158.130, issuers must \naccount for temporary premium credits as reductions in earned premium in the individual and \nsmall group (or merged) markets,62 consistent with any technical guidance set forth in the \n \n61 CMS intends to consider adopting a similar approach if temporary premium credits are permitted for 2021 \ncoverage, if appropriate. \n62 While this IFC and the August 4, 2020 memo focus on the individual and small group markets, to remove the \nbarriers in support of issuers offering these premium credits to enrollees impacted by PHE for COVID-19, we note \nthat issuers in the large group market may also, when consistent with state law, offer premium credits and should \nsimilarly report the lower, adjusted amount that accounts for the premium credits for MLR purposes.\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 B-I 92 INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE to the public UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW:  This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential .

Background \nCMS develops and publicly posts a 5-star rating system for Medicare Advantage (MA) \nand Part D plans based on its authority to disseminate comparative information, including about \nquality, to beneficiaries under sections 1851(d) and 1860D-1(c) of the Act and authority to \ncollect various types of quality data under section 1852(e) of the Act. The Star Rating system for \nMA and Part D plans is also the basis for determining quality bonus payment (QBP) status for \nMA plans under section 1853(o) of the Act and the amount of beneficiary rebates under section \n1854(b) of the Act.  As background, approximately $12 billion for 2020 will be paid as part of \nQBPs in the form of higher benchmarks for both Individual and Employer Group Waiver Plans, \nwhich represent about 4.35 percent of the total MA benchmarks.  Cost plans under section 1876 \nof the Act are also included in the MA and Part D Star Rating system, as codified at 42 CFR \n417.472(k).   \nThe Star Ratings are generally based on measures of performance during a period that is \n2 calendar years before the year for which the Star Ratings are issued; for example, 2022 Star \nRatings will generally be based on performance during 2020.  We use a variety of data sources to \nmeasure quality and performance of contracts, such as CMS administrative data, surveys of \nenrollees, information from health and drug plans, and data collected by CMS contractors.  \nVarious regulations require plans to report on quality improvement and quality assurance and to \nprovide data which we can use to help beneficiaries compare plans (for example, \u00a7\u00a7 417.472(j) \nand (k), 422.152(b), 423.153(c), and 423.156).  In addition, we can require plans to report \nstatistics and other information in specific categories (\u00a7\u00a7 422.516 and 423.514).  Data from these \nsources and other sources are used to calculate measures of plan sponsor performance each year,\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 B-J 94 INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE to the public UNLESS AUTHORIZED by law:  This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential .

The Star Ratings are central in providing comparative \ninformation to enrollees and are also used to determine whether an MA plan is eligible for a QBP \nand the amount of beneficiary rebates.   \nSections 1853(o) and 1854(b)(1)(c) of the Act provide for quality ratings, based on a 5-\nstar rating system and the information collected under section 1852(e) of the Act, to be used in \ncalculating payment to MA organizations beginning in 2012.  Specifically, these provisions \nprovide, respectively, for an increase in the benchmark against which MA organizations bid and \nin the portion of the savings between the bid and the benchmark available to the MA \norganization to use as a rebate.  In addition, CMS assigns both low and high performing icons, \nwhich are displayed on https://www.medicare.gov/plan-compare/, to help Medicare beneficiaries \nmake plan decisions, based on either consistently low performance (2.5 or fewer stars at the \nsummary rating level) for 3 or more years or receipt of 5 stars for the highest rating in any given \nyear.   \nThere are other regulations, regarding marketing authority, special enrollment periods, \nand contract terminations, that are tied to the Star Ratings, demonstrating how the Star Ratings \nare important to the MA and Part D programs as a whole.  Because the Star Ratings serve a \nvariety of purposes for CMS, cost plans, and MA and Part D plans, we assume plans engage in \nmultiple activities during the measurement period to improve their Star Ratings.  Therefore, it is \nnecessary to adopt rules for, and provide information about how performance in 2020 \u2013 during \nthe PHE for COVID-19 \u2013 will be used in the Star Ratings program as quickly as possible. \nWithout adopting these rules immediately, plans will believe that, based on current rules, CMS \nwill be unable to assign Star Ratings for Contract Year 2022 and be unable to pay QBPs for \nContract Year 2023. Given the significant impact of QBPs on overall plan payments, described\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            The Star Ratings are central in providing comparative information to enrollees and are also used to determine whether an MA plan is eligible for a QBP and the amount of beneficiary rebates .

Delaying these \nchanges would limit (or eliminate) the time left in the 2020 measurement period for plans to \nmanage their performance based on these changes. \nIn the March 31st COVID-19 IFC, we adopted a series of changes to the 2021 and 2022 \nStar Ratings to accommodate the disruption to data collection and impact on performance posed \nby the PHE for COVID-19.  The Star Ratings changes adopted in that rule addressed the need of \nhealth and drug plans and their providers to curtail certain data collections and to adapt their \ncurrent practices in light of the PHE for COVID-19 and the need to care for the most vulnerable \npatients, such as the elderly and those with chronic health conditions.  As explained in the March \n31st COVID-19 IFC, we believe that there will be changes in measure-level scores because of \nincreased healthcare utilization due to COVID-19, reduced or delayed non-COVID-19 care due \nto advice to patients to delay routine and/or elective care, and changes in non-COVID-19 \ninpatient utilization. We realize that this will impact the data collected during the 2020 \nmeasurement year which will impact the 2022 Part C and D Star Ratings.  Thus, as part of the \nMarch 31st COVID-19 IFC, we made some adjustments to account for the potential decreases in \nmeasure-level scores so health and drug plans can have some degree of certainty knowing that \nthe Star Ratings will be adjusted and can continue their focus on patients who are most in need \nright now.   \nSpecifically, the March 31st COVID-19 IFC:\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            Without immediate action, plans would not have a clear incentive to focus on providing quality care for enrollees impacted by COVID-19 .

Impact of COVID-19 on the Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstance Policy for the 2022 \nStar Ratings  \nThe March 31st COVID-19 IFC amended, as necessary, certain calculations for the 2021 \nand 2022 Part C and D Star Ratings to incorporate changes to address the expected impact of the \nPHE for COVID-19 on data collection and performance in 2020 that were immediately apparent.  \nAs the PHE for COVID-19 has progressed and various federal and state agencies have taken \nsteps to address the PHE, we have become aware that application of the current Star Ratings \ndisaster policy for extreme and uncontrollable circumstances (\u00a7\u00a7 422.166(i) and 423.186(i)) will \ncause unintended and unworkable consequences for the 2022 Star Ratings, which will be based \non the 2020 measurement period for cost, MA, and Part D plans.  The Star Ratings disaster \npolicy for extreme and uncontrollable circumstances was developed with natural disasters such \nas hurricanes and wildfires in mind.  Those types of emergencies typically impact well-defined \ngeographic areas. The policy uses declarations by the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n(FEMA) of counties or county-equivalents as Individual Assistance areas that make up all or part \nof a contract\u2019s service area, as well as whether the contract's service area is within an \n\u201cemergency area\u201d during an \u201cemergency period\u201d as defined in section 1135(g) of the Act, as a \ncondition for applying an adjustment to how the Star Ratings are calculated for the contract.  \nContracts with a certain minimum percentage of enrollees residing in an area declared as an \nIndividual Assistance area are eligible for Star Ratings adjustments for extreme and \nuncontrollable circumstances.  The disaster policy was not designed to address global pandemics.  \nIn the past several years that we have used the extreme and uncontrollable circumstance\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            The March 31st COVID-19 IFC amended, as necessary, certain calculations for the 2021 and 2022 Part C and D Star Ratings to incorporate changes .

As of July \n28, 2020, 51 out of 55 states/territories65 covering all counties or county-equivalents within these \nstates and territories have been designated as Individual Assistance areas due to COVID-19 with \nan incident period starting in 2020 (thus affecting the 2020 measurement year), and this number \ncould continue to grow throughout 2020 as the PHE for COVID-19 evolves.  This means that the \nPHE for COVID-19 now meets the Star Ratings criteria for an extreme and uncontrollable \ncircumstance in nearly all states/territories (and service areas), and most contracts would be \neligible for the extreme and uncontrollable circumstance adjustments to their 2022 Star Ratings \nas a result of the PHE for COVID-19.  \nUnder the current disaster policy, for all non-CAHPS measures, the numeric scores for \ncontracts with 60 percent or more of their enrollees living in a FEMA-designated Individual \nAssistance area at the time of the extreme and uncontrollable circumstance are excluded from: \n(1) the measure-level cut point calculations for non-CAHPS measures; and (2) the performance \nsummary and variance thresholds for the Reward Factor as described at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(i)(9)(i) and \n(i)(10)(i), and 423.186(i)(7)(i) and (i)(8)(i).

Up until now, disasters have been localized, and the 60 \npercent rule has removed only a small fraction of contracts (that is, less than 5 percent of \ncontracts on average).   \nThe unprecedented impact of COVID-19 creates a new methodological issue where, \nwithout a revision to our current disaster policy rules for calculating the measure-level cut points \nfor the 2022 Star Ratings, we will not have enough contracts to reliably calculate the non-\nCAHPS measure-level cut points.  Consequently, CMS will not be able to assign Star Ratings for \nall non-CAHPS measures.  Similarly, we will not have enough contracts to reliably calculate the \nperformance summary and variance thresholds for the Reward Factor.  Applying the 60 percent \nrule for extreme and uncontrollable circumstances to the 2022 Star Ratings would result in \nremoval of a large proportion of contracts (close to 98 percent) from threshold calculations, \nresulting in too few contracts to reliably calculate cut points using the clustering methodology for \nthe non-CAHPS measures and too few contracts to reliably calculate the weighted means and \nvariance used to calculate the Reward Factor.  Due to the unprecedented way the PHE for \nCOVID-19 has affected all contracts in 2020, and the fact that a majority of the country has been \ndesignated as Individual Assistance areas, we are creating special rules for the 2022 Star Ratings \nto remove the 60 percent rule to avoid having to exclude the vast majority of contracts from the \nmethodology used to assign Star Ratings which would result in unreliable ratings or missing data \nfor all contracts in the 2022 Star Ratings.      \nUnder our current regulation, the 60 percent rule would remove nearly all values from the \ncalculation of cut points and the Reward Factor for the 2022 Star Ratings and, if we are unable to \ncalculate non-CAHPS measure-level cut points for the 2022 Star Ratings (such as because of the \napplication of the 60 percent rule), all contracts will have missing measure-level Star Ratings for\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 B-J 100 INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE to the public UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW:  This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential .

In that circumstance, we will not have enough measures with Star \nRatings to calculate either the 2022 overall or summary Star Ratings or 2023 QBPs.  In addition \nto the 60 percent rule, for contracts that have 25 percent or more of their enrollees living in \nFEMA-designated Individual Assistance areas, our current regulations at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(i) and \n423.186(i) apply various rules including permitting use of the previous year\u2019s measure-level \nrating and corresponding measure score if it is higher on most Star Rating measures.  However, \n\u00a7\u00a7 422.166(i)(8) and 423.186(i)(6) state that if the measure-level rating is missing for most \nmeasures in the current or prior year and a comparison cannot be done, the contract gets the \ncurrent year\u2019s measure-level rating. Therefore, under our current regulations, without a change to \nthe 60 percent rule to ensure that contracts receive measure-level ratings for the 2022 Star \nRatings, we would not be able to apply the 25 percent rule to compare the 2022 measure-level \nStar Ratings to the 2021 measure-level Star Ratings, and nearly all contracts would have missing \n2022 overall and summary Star Ratings and 2023 QBPs. \nThe change adopted by this IFC will remove application of the 60 percent rule and avoid \nthe exclusion of contracts with 60 percent or more of their enrollees living in FEMA-designated \nIndividual Assistance areas from calculation of the non-CAHPS measure-level cut points and \ncalculation of the Reward Factor for the 2022 Star Ratings.  By removing application of this \nparticular exclusion, the performance of contracts in 2020 in these service areas will be used to \ncalculate the cut points for all non-CAHPS measures and to calculate the Reward Factor; subject \nto these changes, all other Star Ratings rules (as revised in the March 31st COVID-19 IFC) will \napply.

Given the unprecedented impacts of the PHE for \nCOVID-19, it is important to be able to calculate the 2022 Star Ratings to help to continue to \ndrive quality improvement for plans and providers.  \n3. Provisions of IFC \nIn this IFC, we are adopting a change to tailor the existing disaster policy described at \n\u00a7\u00a7 422.166(i) and 423.186(i) to address the impact of the PHE for COVID-19 and in calculating \nthe 2022 Part C and D Star Ratings.  As the current rules are written, we will not be able to \ncalculate the 2022 overall or summary Star Ratings or 2023 QBP ratings, and the change adopted \nin this IFC will avoid that outcome and preserve the ability to calculate and issue 2022 Star \nRatings.   \nFurthermore, plans need to know this change so they have certainty about how their \nratings will be calculated which will allow them to focus on providing the best care possible to \nbeneficiaries during the remainder of the 2020 measurement period.  Without knowing the \nchanges made by this IFC to the methodology for calculating the 2022 Star Ratings, plans could \nhave conflicting priorities between continued focus on caring for enrollees impacted by COVID-\n19 and keeping Medicare beneficiaries safe, while at the same time wanting to ensure that future \nStar Ratings and QBP ratings are not impacted by the PHE for COVID-19 which could \nnegatively impact future benefits offered by MA organizations.

This means that CMS will use the performance \nscores for contracts for the 2020 performance and measurement period to establish cut points for \nnon-CAHPS measures and the Reward Factor for the 2022 Star Ratings, subject to the other rules \nin the Star Ratings methodology, including the specific rules adopted in the March 31st COVID-\n19 IFC.  We are not modifying the 25 percent rules, even though it is clear that the 25 percent \nrules will result in nearly all contracts being \u201caffected contracts\u201d and eligible for adjustment to \ntheir measure-level ratings for the 2022 Star Ratings because the PHE for COVID-19 was an \nextreme and uncontrollable circumstance that may have negatively impacted contracts\u2019 \nperformance on Star Ratings measures.  Under the 25 percent rules at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(i)(2) through \n(6) and 423.186(i)(2) through (5), contracts with at least 25 percent of their service area in a \nFEMA-designated Individual Assistance area in 2020 will receive the higher of their measure-\nlevel rating from the current and prior Star Ratings years for purposes of calculating the 2022\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            CMS modifies the calculation of the 2022 Part C and D Star Ratings to address the application of the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy for the PHE for COVID-19 .

The March 31st COVID-19 IFC made some \nchanges to the methodology for the 2022 Star Ratings so as not to inappropriately incentivize \nactions by plans and healthcare providers that are not directly related to the PHE for COVID-19 \nand to provide assurances to Medicare health and drug plans about how performance changes \ndriven or caused by the PHE for COVID-19 will be addressed in the 2022 Star Ratings.  The \nsignificant number of declarations of Individual Assistance areas makes it impossible to calculate \nthe cut points of non-CAHPS measures for the 2022 Star Ratings since almost all contracts will \nbe excluded from the calculations as a result of the 60 percent exclusion rule.  In this IFC, at \u00a7\u00a7 \n422.166(i)(11) and 423.186(i)(9), we are revising, for 2022 Star Ratings only, the current disaster \npolicy codified at \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(i) and 423.186(i) to: (1) remove the 60 percent exclusion rule for \ncut point calculations for non-CAHPS measures; and (2) remove the 60 percent exclusion rule \nfor the determination of the performance summary and variance thresholds for the Reward \nFactor.  The new regulation for MA Star Ratings specifically provides that CMS will not apply \nthe provisions \u00a7\u00a7 422.166(i)(9) or (i)(10) in calculating the 2022 Star Ratings, and the new \nregulation for the Part D Star Ratings provides that CMS will not apply the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 \n423.186(i)(7) or (i)(8) in calculating the 2022 Star Ratings.

Quality Performance Category: Expansion of Telehealth Codes Used in Beneficiary \nAssignment for the CMS Web Interface and CAHPS for MIPS Survey  \na.  Background \nOn March 17, 2020, we announced (https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-\nsheets/medicare-telemedicine-health-care-provider-fact-sheet) the expansion of payment for \ntelehealth services on a temporary and emergency basis pursuant to waiver authority added under \nsection 1135(b)(8) of the Act by the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental \nAppropriations Act, 2020 (Pub. L. 116-123, enacted March 6, 2020) such that Medicare can pay \nfor telehealth services, including office, hospital, and other visits furnished by physicians and \nother practitioners to patients located anywhere in the country, including in a patient\u2019s place of \nresidence, starting March 6, 2020.  In the context of the PHE for COVID-19, we recognize that \nphysicians and other healthcare professionals are faced with new challenges regarding potential \nexposure risks, including for Medicare beneficiaries, for healthcare providers, and for members \nof the community at large.  For example, the CDC has urged healthcare professionals to make \nevery effort to interview persons under investigation for infection by telephone, text messaging \nsystem, or video conference instead of in-person (85 FR 27582).  In the March 31st COVID-19 \nIFC, to facilitate the use of telecommunications technology as a safe substitute for in-person \nservices, CMS added on an interim basis many services to the list of eligible Medicare telehealth \nservices, eliminating frequency limitations and other requirements associated with particular \nservices furnished via telehealth, and clarifying several payment rules that apply to other services \nthat are furnished using telecommunications technologies that can reduce exposure risks (85 FR \n19232).\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 B-K 106 INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE to the public UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW:  This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential .

When furnished under the telehealth rules, these specified \nMedicare telehealth services are reported using the same codes used for the \u201cface-to-face\u201d \nservices, but are furnished using audio/video, real-time, interactive communications technology \ninstead of in person.  As such, the majority of the codes for primary care services included in the \nadditional telehealth services added in the March 31st COVID-19 IFC for purposes of the PHE \nfor COVID-19 are already included in the definition of primary care services for purposes of the \nMIPS beneficiary assignment methodology for the CMS Web Interface and CAHPS for MIPS \nsurvey (81 FR 77168 through 77169; and 82 FR 53646 through 53647).     \nIn the March 31st COVID-19 IFC, we also established flexibilities and separate payment \nfor certain services that are furnished virtually using communication technologies, but that are \nnot considered Medicare telehealth services such as virtual check-ins and e-visits.  Additionally, \nwe established separate payment for telephone E/M and other services codes during the PHE for \nCOVID-19.  The communications technology-based services (CTBS) and the telephone E/M \nservices are not currently included in the definition of primary care services that is used for \npurposes of the MIPS beneficiary assignment methodology for the CMS Web Interface and \nCAHPS for MIPS survey. \n We believe it is critical to include the codes for CTBS and telephone E/M services, as \nidentified and discussed later in this section, in the definition of primary care services to ensure \nthese services are included in our determination of where beneficiaries receive the plurality of \ntheir primary care for purposes of beneficiary assignment.

By including services provided virtually, either through telehealth \nor other uses of communications technology, we ensure that this care is appropriately reflected in \nour consideration of where beneficiaries receive the plurality of their primary care, for purposes \nof assigning beneficiaries to groups and virtual groups.      \nb.  Use of Codes for Virtual Check-ins, Remote Evaluations, E-Visits, and Telephone E/M \nServices in MIPS Beneficiary Assignment for the CMS Web Interface and CAHPS for MIPS \nSurvey  \nWe have added new services to the separately billable CTBS under the PFS over the past \nseveral years and as a result of the PHE for COVID-19, we expect that the utilization of CTBS \nwill substantially increase during the PHE for COVID-19 and thereafter.  We believe that \nclinicians are increasingly using such services as a key component of their ongoing primary care.  \nAt \u00a7 414.1305, we are codifying the definition of primary care services for purposes of MIPS \nbeneficiary assignment methodology for the CMS Web Interface and CAHPS for MIPS survey. \nThe included codes consist of previously finalized codes that are already considered primary care \nservices and additional codes that CMS will be treating as primary care services for the duration \nof the PHE for COVID-19.

Improvement Activities Performance Category:  Improvement Activities Inventory Update \na.  Background \nThe CY 2018 Quality Payment Program final rule (82 FR 53660) finalized that we would \nadd new improvement activities or make modifications to existing improvement activities in the \nImprovement Activities Inventory through notice-and-comment rulemaking.  An improvement \nactivity means an activity that relevant MIPS eligible clinician, organizations and other relevant \nstakeholders identify as improving clinical practice or care delivery and that the Secretary \ndetermines, when effectively executed, is likely to result in improved outcomes.  We refer \nreaders to Table H in the Appendix of the CY 2017 Quality Payment Program final rule (81 FR \n77177 through 77199), Tables F and G in the Appendix of the CY 2018 Quality Payment \nProgram final rule (82 FR 54175 through 54229), Tables A and B in the Appendix 2 of the CY \n2019 PFS final rule (83 FR 60286 through 60303), and Tables A, B, and C in the Appendix 2 of \nthe CY 2020 PFS final rule (84 FR 63514 through 63538) for our previously finalized \nImprovement Activities Inventory.

In response, in the March 31st IFC for COVID-19 (85 FR 19276 through 19277), we \nadded one new improvement activity to the Improvement Activities Inventory for the CY 2020 \nperformance period in response to the PHE titled \u201cCOVID-19 Clinical Trials.\u201d  As described in \nthe March 31st IFC for COVID-19, this improvement activity promotes clinician participation in \na COVID-19 clinical trial utilizing a drug or biological product to treat a patient with a COVID-\n19 infection.67 We stated that to receive credit for this improvement activity, a clinician must \nattest to participation in a COVID-19 clinical trial utilizing a drug or biological product to treat a \npatient with a COVID-19 infection and report their findings through a clinical data repository or \nclinical data registry (85 FR 19276).  In that IFC, we also stated that we believe that participation \nin this activity would likely result in improved outcomes by improving the collection of data \nclinicians use for the care of their patients as they monitor and manage COVID-19 and drive care \nimprovements (85 FR 19277).  We stated that we believe that encouraging clinicians to utilize an \nopen source clinical data repository or clinical data registry for data reporting will bring the \nresults of their research to the forefront of healthcare far quicker than if it goes through the cycle \nof peer review and publishing (85 FR 19277).  In addition, we stated that we believe that \ncentralized data could improve clinical practice and care delivery (85 FR 19277).   \nb.

Some stakeholders believed that clinicians \nproviding care to patients with COVID-19 outside of a clinical trial that report that data through \na clinical data registry should receive credit for this activity.  It has come to our attention that \nclinical data registries not only collect data as part of clinical trials, but also collect data from \nclinicians not participating in clinical trials.  The improvement activity as written was causing \nconfusion for clinicians and groups attempting to meet the needs of patients and address gaps in \nresearch.  Since IA_ERP_3 titled \u201cCOVID-19 Clinical Trials\u201d was established, this improvement \nactivity has been the subject of approximately 30 percent of the inquiries to the Quality Payment \nProgram help desk, demonstrating the desire for clinicians to improve clinical care and overall \noutcomes for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by conducting this improvement activity, but \nalso indicating the need for further clarity in its activity description.   \nAs a result, we are expanding the improvement activity to include clinicians participating \nin the care of a patient diagnosed with COVID-19 who simultaneously submit their clinical \npatient data to a clinical data registry for research.  Thus, in order to receive credit for this \nimprovement activity, a MIPS eligible clinician or group must:  (1) participate in a COVID-19 \nclinical trial utilizing a drug or biological product to treat a patient with a COVID-19 infection \nand report their findings through a clinical data repository or clinical data registry for the \nduration of their study; or (2) participate in the care of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            The Quality Payment Program help desk tracks, documents, and resolves inquiries submitted by MIPS eligible clinicians and groups .

Data would be submitted to the extent permitted by applicable privacy \nand security laws.  We are also modifying the improvement activity title to reflect this change.  \nFor purposes of this improvement activity, clinical data registries must meet the \nfollowing requirements:  (1) the receiving entity must declare that they are ready to accept data \nas a clinical registry; and (2) be using the data to improve population health outcomes.  Most \npublic health agencies and clinical data registries declare readiness to accept data from clinicians \nvia a public online posting.  Clinical data registries should make publicly available specific \ninformation on what data the registry gathers, technical requirements or specifications for how \nthe registry can receive the data, and how the registry may use, re-use, or disclose individually \nidentifiable data it receives.  For purposes of credit toward this improvement activity, any data \nshould be sent to the clinical data registry in a structured format, which the registry is capable of \nreceiving.  A MIPS-eligible clinician may submit the data using any standard or format that is \nsupported by the clinician\u2019s health IT systems, including but not limited to, certified functions \nwithin those systems.  Such methods may include, but are not limited to, a secure upload \nfunction on a web portal, or submission via an intermediary, such as a health information \nexchange.

We believe that all clinical data gathered in the \ntreatment of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 may be helpful in finding a solution to end this \npandemic.  We believe encouraging clinicians collectively to utilize a clinical data registry for \ndata reporting could facilitate sharing of data for use in additional clinical studies with larger \nsample sizes.  These additional and larger clinical studies are likely to identify efficacy of certain \ntreatments, which in turn could result in wider improvements in health outcomes, including \nreduced severity and mortality due to COVID-19 across the nation.  This could benefit patients \nnationwide as well as improve clinical practice and care delivery for the patients of the clinician \nattesting to this improvement activity.  We would like to encourage all clinicians to provide data \nthrough an open source clinical data repository or clinical data registry, meaning that the results \nof research are made public, including via publications and scientific data sources, which enables \nreuse, increases transparency, and facilitates reproducibility of research results.  Furthermore, a \nclinical data registry may allow such data to be publicly available which may be used for \nresearch.     \nWe believe that this improvement activity would incentivize clinicians to submit \nCOVID-19 data to clinical data registries, which is imperative to help combat the PHE for \nCOVID-19 because the data could be used to inform research and treatment options and \npotentially save lives.

The submission \nrequirements for the Promoting Interoperability performance category would not be changed by \nthis improvement activity.  Thus a clinician could report COVID-19 data to a public health \nagency or clinical data registry as part of fulfilling one of the required Public Health and Clinical \nData Exchange Objective reporting options under the Promoting Interoperability performance \ncategory and include it in their Promoting Interoperability performance category data \nsubmission.

Requirement for Long-Term Care (LTC) Facilities to Test Facility Residents and Staff for \nCOVID-19 \nUnder sections 1866 and 1902 of the Act, providers of services seeking to participate in \nthe Medicare or Medicaid program, or both, must enter into an agreement with the Secretary or \nthe state Medicaid agency, as appropriate.  LTC facilities seeking to be Medicare and Medicaid \nproviders of services must be certified as meeting federal participation requirements. LTC \nfacilities include skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) for Medicare and nursing facilities (NFs) for \nMedicaid.  The federal participation requirements for SNFs, NFs, and dually certified facilities, \nare set forth in sections 1819 and 1919 of the Act and codified in the implementing regulations at \n42 CFR part 483, subpart B.   \nSections 1819(d)(4)(B) and 1919(d)(4)(B) of the Act explicitly authorize the Secretary to \nissue any regulations deemed necessary to protect the health and safety of residents.  Sections \n1819(d) (3) and 1919(d)(3) of the Act authorize the Secretary to establish criteria for assessing a \nfacility\u2019s compliance with such regulations with respect to infection control.  Under the explicit \ninstructions of Congress, existing regulations at \u00a7 483.80 require facilities to establish and \nmaintain an infection control program designed to provide a safe, sanitary, and comfortable \nenvironment in which residents reside and to help prevent the development and transmission of \ndisease and infection.  \nAfter several months facing the effects of COVID-19, we believe there exists a need to \nstrengthen the requirements for LTC facilities to better protect residents, members of a high-risk \npopulation.  As demonstrated by the PHE for COVID-19, a strong infection control program is \ncritical to protect the health and safety of both residents and healthcare personnel of LTC \nfacilities.

To support national efforts to control the spread of COVID-19, we are revising the \nLTC facility infection control regulations at \u00a7 483.80 to establish a new requirement for LTC \nfacilities to test their facility residents and staff, including individuals providing services under \narrangement and volunteers. We believe these requirements will positively and substantially \nimpact efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 in LTC facilities.   \n1.  LTC Facility Resident and Staff Testing \nThe CDC published guidelines titled, Testing Guidelines for Nursing Homes, which note \nthat, \u201cNursing home residents are at high risk for infection, serious illness, and death from \nCOVID-19. Testing for [COVID-19]\u2026 can detect current infections\u2026among residents in \nnursing homes.  Testing is an important addition to other infection prevention and control \nrecommendations aimed at preventing [COVID-19] from entering nursing homes, detecting \ncases quickly, and stopping transmission.\u201d71  CMS recognizes the need for  facilities to protect \nLTC facility staff while preventing the spread of COVID-19 within the facility. As a result, we \nare amending the current infection control requirements for LTC facilities at \u00a7 483.80 by adding \na paragraph (h) that requires a facility to test all of its residents and facility staff for COVID-19. \nUnder this requirement, \u201cstaff\u201d are considered any individuals employed by the facility, any \n \n70 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (2020).

This IFC directly \nsupports that goal by requiring COVID-19 reporting by hospitals, CAHs, and CLIA laboratories; \nby requiring testing of nursing home staff and residents; and by strengthening enforcement of \nimportant nursing home infection prevention and control requirements related to COVID-19 \nreporting.  It is critically important that we implement the policies in this IFC as quickly as \npossible.  As we are in the midst of the PHE for COVID-19, we find good cause to waive notice \nand comment rulemaking as we believe it would be impracticable and contrary to the public \ninterest for us to undertake normal notice and comment rulemaking procedures.

We have already found that schemes are occurring whereby fraudulent laboratories \nand telemarketing companies are directly contacting beneficiaries, oftentimes using stolen \nidentifying information, to solicit items and services payable by Medicare under the guise of \nCOVID-19 treatment or prevention.  In fact, an HHS Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) \nfraud alert75 describes situations in which scammers are offering unapproved and illegitimate \nCOVID-19 tests and other services to Medicare beneficiaries in exchange for personal details, \nincluding Medicare information.  The financial impact of this fraud risk is exacerbated by the \nability of the laboratory to perform expensive add-on tests, such as to confirm or rule-out \ndiagnoses other than COVID-19, that are not medically necessary.   \nWe also believe that allowing Medicare payment for one test without an order will allow \nbeneficiaries access to urgent testing, as we outlined in the May 8th COVID-19 IFC, yet also \nprovide sufficient opportunity for beneficiaries to seek out the medical care needed to ensure that \nthe test results are interpreted and acted upon appropriately, both from the perspective of the \nindividual beneficiary and also in the context of the area of the country in which the beneficiary \n \n75 https://oig.hhs.gov/coronavirus/fraud-alert-covid19.asp.\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 C 133: Not released to the public unless authorized to receive the information .

Executing an effective, regional response to COVID-19 disease requires coordinated \neffort and guidance by qualified medical professionals who know how to interpret and react to \ntesting results.  When a physician or other health care provider is able to counsel patients who \nare being tested for COVID-19, beneficiaries may be more likely to isolate themselves more \nquickly, which may reduce transmission in the community. Consistent with this information, \nCMS and CDC recently announced that they are taking steps to ensure that physicians and other \npractitioners who counsel patients on COVID-19 testing are paid for these services.76  \nWe also believe that pharmacists and other healthcare professionals play an important \nrole in the response to the PHE for COVID-19, and to further ensure that beneficiaries continue \nto have access to appropriate COVID-19 testing even when some professional care is not \nseparately billable under Medicare, we are establishing a policy whereby otherwise covered \nCOVID-19 and specified related tests ordered by pharmacists and other healthcare professionals \nwho are authorized to order diagnostic laboratory tests in accordance with state scope of practice \nand other pertinent laws are covered for the duration of the PHE for COVID-19.   \nIn this IFC, we are updating the extraordinary circumstances exceptions (ECEs) we \ngranted on March 22, 2020, for the ESRD QIP, HAC Reduction Program, HRRP, and Hospital \nVBP Program in response to the PHE for COVID-19.

Applying the 60 percent rule to 2022 Star Ratings would result in removal of a large fraction \nof contracts from threshold calculations, resulting in too few contracts to reliably calculate cut \npoints for non-CAHPS measures using the clustering methodology and too few contracts to \nreliably calculate and apply Reward Factors for 2022 Star Ratings; failure to adopt the change \nwould result in CMS\u2019 inability to calculate 2022 Star Ratings.  This change to the calculation \nmethodology for the 2022 Star Ratings is urgently necessary to ensure that MA organizations, \ncost plans, and Part D plan sponsors are aware during the 2020 measurement period how their \nperformance in the 2020 measurement period will be used in calculating the Star Ratings. \nWe believe that the clarifications are immediately necessary to address both program \nintegrity and clinical issues that have arisen since the publication of the May 8th COVID-19 IFC.  \nWe believe that it is contrary to the public interest to allow open-ended coverage of COVID-19 \ntesting without an order due to the significant potential for fraud, waste, and abuse, as well as \npublic health and safety issues that would arise from beneficiaries being subjected to testing \nwithout proper medical necessity or oversight.\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 C 135: \"INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW:  This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential\" The IFC also modifies the calculation of the 2022 Part C and D Star Ratings to address the application of the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy for the PHE for COVID-19 .\n  #       ", "### Instruction:\n  #       Summarize the following article:\n\n  #       CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 C 136 \nINFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: \nThis information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential.

We estimate that the approximately 30 percent (n=77,024) of the \ntotal CLIA-certified laboratories could potentially be performing SARS-CoV-2 and need to \nreport test results in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 493.41 and 493.1100(a). \nFor purposes of this IFC, we are estimating a wide range of test volumes to approximate \na range from low volume laboratory to a laboratory using high throughput technology.  We \nestimate that a low volume laboratory may report out 20 test results in a 24-hour period and a \nhigh throughput laboratory may report out 500 test results during the same period.  We estimate \nit would take each laboratory approximately 0.5 hours for low volume laboratories and \napproximately 3 hours for a high throughput laboratory to report this information to be in \ncompliance with this new requirement.  The burden hours range from 38,512 to 231,072 (77,024 \nlaboratories x 0.5 or 3 hours).

The total cost would range from \n$1,481,942 to $8,891,651 (38,512 to 231,072 x $38.48) per day to collect the required \ninformation.  Reporting of test results would be an ongoing burden for each laboratory \nperforming this type of testing. \nD.  Laboratory Costs to Update Policies and Procedures \nWe expect that the approximately 77,024 laboratories performing SARS-CoV-2 testing \nwould incur costs for the time needed to review the revised reporting regulations and update their \npolicies and procedures to be in compliance.  We estimate the total one-time burden per \nlaboratory to review and update affected policies and procedures is 5 hours.  The burden hours \nare 385,120 (77,024 laboratories x 5 hours).

Accreditation Organization (AO) and Exempt State (ES) Costs to Update Standards for \nReporting SARS-CoV-2 Test Results  \nWe would expect the seven approved AOs and two ESs would have to review their \nstandards, provide updates and submit the changes to CMS related to SARS-CoV-2 test reporting \nfor approval (9 organizations/exempt states x 25 or 30 hours). The CLIA regulations require both \nthe AOs and ESs to have requirements that are equal to, or more stringent than the CLIA \ncondition-level requirements, and the laboratory would meet the condition-level requirements if \nit were inspected against these requirements84. We assume a one-time cost of 25 to 30 hours to \nidentify the applicable legal obligations and to develop the updated standards needed to reflect \nthe new requirements for SARS-CoV-2 testing.  The burden hours range from 225 to 270 (9 \nAO/ESs x 25 or 30 hours).

In the case of the accredited laboratories, the \nlaboratories identified as not reporting SARS-CoV-2 results as required would result in CMS \ntaking an enforcement action as described in section II. of this IFC.  As stated in section IV.G. of \nthis IFC, the CLIA regulations require both the AOs and ESs to have requirements that are equal \nto, or more stringent, the CLIA condition-level requirements, so we would expect the AOs and \nESs to have equivalent reporting requirements to CMS.  AOs do not impose CMPs; however, \nESs do have the ability to impose CMPs so we would expect ESs to have an equivalent penalty \nstructure to CMS.  The ES are generally approved by CMS to operate their own oversight \nprograms so we would expect that the two ESs would report these laboratories to CMS, but \nwould then impose the penalties based on their CMS-approved updated standards.

Requirements for Long-Term Care (LTC) Facilities to Test Facility Residents and Staff for \nCOVID-19 \nAs discussed in section II.J. of this IFC, we are revising the regulations at \u00a7483.80(h) to \nrequire LTC facilities to test residents and facility staff, including individuals providing services \nunder arrangement and volunteers, for COVID-19.  We are also requiring at \u00a7483.80(h)(3)(i) that \nfor each instance of resident and staff COVID-19 testing (which includes testing of individuals \nproviding services under arrangement and volunteers), the facility document that testing was \ncompleted and the results of each test. We expect that this documentation would be located in the \nstaff personnel record for all staff. In the case of individuals who are providing services under \narrangement at the facility, we expect that this documentation be located in the record or file that \nthe facility maintains for such individuals. In the event that no such record or file is maintained, \nwe expect that the agreement for the services that are being provided under arrangement include \na process for documenting these results.  Consistent with the documentation requirements we are \nadding for LTC facility staff, we are requiring at \u00a7 483.80(h)(3)(ii) that the facility document in \nthe resident\u2019s medical record that testing was offered, completed (as appropriate to the resident\u2019s \ntesting status), and the results of each test.   \nBased on data from the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s report on coronavirus statistics \n(https://www.kff.org/report-section/covid-19-and-workers-at-risk-examining-the-long-term-care-\nworkforce-tables), we estimate that 1.8 million LTC facility staff would be tested for COVID-19 \ninitially for each facility.

Furthermore, we estimate that, based on the guidelines given regarding \ntesting frequency, the criteria for conducting a test, and the response time for test result, not all \nstaff will be tested on the same frequency. For example, a third of the staff population could be \ntested weekly and two thirds of the staff population could receive a test every ten days or \nmonthly.  However, with variables that are not knowable at this time, we have provided an \nestimate based on an average schedule of all staff receiving a test every 14 days and residents to \nbe tested monthly during the PHE for COVID-19. We estimate that it would take 2 minutes to \nprovide documentation in 1.8 million records of staff members for 30 weeks (from September \n2020 to March 2021) to record the test was administered and to record the test results. We also \nestimate that it would take 2 minutes to provide the same documentation in 1.3 million medical \nrecords of residents for the same period of time. The annual and ongoing cost to comply with this \nrequirement can be further assessed based on guidelines established by the Secretary.  The \nongoing burden associated with these reporting activities will, if necessary, be submitted under \nOMB Control Number 0938-New. \nFor the purpose of this analysis, we estimate that it would take 2 minutes to document the \ninitial test and that a healthcare support worker (31-9099) would perform this task at an hourly \nwage of $19.24 per hour as published by the BLS in 2019.87  The wage rate would be doubled to \n$38.48 to include overhead and fringe benefits. Based on our assumptions, we estimate that the \ntotal cost to document the testing results for staff and LTC residents over the estimated course of \nthe PHE for COVID-19 would be $48,158.193.

Medical Loss Ratio Premium Reporting Requirements \nIn section II.G.3. of this IFC, we are clarifying that issuers that elect to provide temporary \npremium credits to consumers in 2020 must account for these credits as reductions to premium \nfor the applicable months during 2020 when reporting earned premium for the applicable MLR \nreporting year90. We do not anticipate that this clarification will require changes to the MLR \nAnnual Reporting Form or change the associated burden for issuers.

Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) Updates \nIn section II.I. of this IFC, for the 2020 performance year, we are proposing to include in \nthe MIPS assignment methodology for the CMS Web Interface and CAHPS for MIPS survey the \nfollowing additions due to the PHE for COVID-19:  (1) CPT codes: 99421, 99422, and 99423 \n(codes for online digital E/M service (e-visit)), and 99441, 99442, and 99443 (codes for \ntelephone E/M services); and (2) HCPCS codes: G2010 (code for remote evaluation of patient \nvideo/images) and G2012 (code for virtual check-in).

Statement of Need \nThroughout this IFC, we discuss several changes to payment and coverage policies \nintended to allow healthcare providers and health insurance issuers maximum flexibility to \nminimize the spread of COVID-19 among Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, consumers of \nhealth insurance coverage in the individual and small group insurance markets, healthcare \npersonnel, and the community at large, and increase capacity to address the needs of their \npatients.  The flexibilities and changes contained within this IFC are responsive to this \ndeveloping pandemic emergency and to recent legislation that gives us additional authority.  \nGiven the potentially catastrophic impact to public health, it is difficult to estimate the economic \nimpact of the spread of COVID-19 under current payment rules compared to the rules issued in \nthis IFC.  \n We believe that the needs of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and consumers of \nhealth insurance coverage in the individual and small group insurance markets suffering from \nCOVID-19 will likely test the capacity of the healthcare system over the coming months.  Our \npolicies implemented in this IFC will provide flexibilities, during the PHE for COVID-19, to \nphysicians and other practitioners, and clinical laboratories.  Additionally, the policies and \nregulatory updates implemented in this IFC will increase the affordability and support continuity \nof health insurance coverage for consumers in the individual and small group (or merged) market \nduring the PHE for COVID-19. \nB.  Overall Impact \nWe have examined the potential impacts of this rule as required by Executive Order \n12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (September 30, 1993), Executive Order 13563 on\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 E 155: Not releasable to the public, unless authorized to receive the information .

Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 defines a \n\u201csignificant regulatory action\u201d as an action that is likely to result in a rule:  (1) (having an annual \neffect on the economy of $100 million or more in any 1 year, or adversely and materially \naffecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health \nor safety, or state, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as \u201ceconomically \nsignificant\u201d); (2) creating a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or \nplanned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement grants, \nuser fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel \nlegal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President\u2019s priorities, or the principles set \nforth in the Executive Order.

We are adding \u00a7\u00a7 \n493.41 and 493.1100(a) to require that, during the PHE for COVID-19, as defined in \u00a7400.200, \neach laboratory that performs a test that is intended to detect SARS-CoV-2 or to diagnose a \npossible case of COVID-19 must report SARS-CoV-2 test results in such form and manner, and \nat such timing and frequency, as the Secretary may prescribe.  These anticipated costs would \nresult from laboratories needing to develop a mechanism to collect and report SARS-CoV-2 test \nresults, update policies and procedures, update software, and train personnel. In addition, AOs \nand Exempt States (ESs) will also need to update their laboratory standards and policies and \nprocedures to comply with the new federal regulatory changes.  We have provided an assessment \nof the impact of estimated costs of these changes in Tables 7 and 8.   \nExecutive Order 13771, titled Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, \nwas issued on January 30, 2017 and requires that the costs associated with significant new \nregulations \u201cshall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs \nassociated with at least two prior regulations.\u201d  This IFC\u2019s designation under Executive Order \n13771, titled Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs (82 FR 9339), which was \nissued on January 30, 2017, will be informed by public comments received. \nThe RFA requires agencies to analyze options for regulatory relief of small entities, if a \nrule has a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, \nwe estimate that the great majority of laboratories are small entities, either by being nonprofit \norganizations or by meeting the Small Business Administration definition of a small business \n(having revenues of less than $8.0 million to $41.5 million in any 1 year).

For purposes of this IFC, we expect that approximately 30 percent (n=77,024) of the \ntotal CLIA certified laboratories (n=256,747) could potentially be performing SARS-CoV-2 \ntests.  Further, based on data from the CLIA website, we are estimating that 75 percent of the \nlaboratories have a CoW (n=57,768) and 25 percent have a Certificate of PPM, CoC, CoA, or \nCoR (n=19,256).  Each individual EUA test system authorized by the FDA specifies the settings \nin which the tests are authorized to be used during the PHE for COVID-19.  Generally, COW \nand PPM laboratories include, but are not limited to, the following types of facilities:  physician \noffice laboratories; pharmacies; skilled nursing/nursing facilities; and other types of point-of-care \nfacilities. Generally, we would consider these types of laboratories to be small entities.  \nIndividuals and states are not included in the definition of a small entity.  All laboratories \nperforming SARS-CoV-2 testing are affected by this IFC, and the impact is economically \nsignificant. Therefore, the Secretary has determined that this IFC will have a significant \neconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. \nIn addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires us to prepare a regulatory impact analysis \nif a rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural \nhospitals.  This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA.  For purposes \nof section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside \nof a metropolitan statistical area and has fewer than 100 beds.  There are approximately 905 \nsmall rural hospitals in the U.S.  Of the 905 small rural hospitals, approximately 500 are \nsubsection (d) hospitals paid under IPPS and are subject to the HAC Reduction Program and \nHRRP.  In section II.D. of IFC, we are updating the ECE policy for the two programs to allow \nthe exclusion of data submitted for quarters impacted by the PHE for COVID-19.

All small \nrural hospitals, that is, both subsection (d) and critical access hospitals, often provide very \nlimited laboratory services or may refer all their testing to larger facilities.  We are unable to \nestimate the number of laboratories that support small rural hospitals, but do expect that the rule \nwill have a significant impact on small rural hospitals.  Therefore, the Secretary has determined \nthat this rule will have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small \nrural hospitals.  \nSection 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) also requires that \nagencies assess anticipated costs and benefits before issuing any proposed rule, or any final rule \npreceded by a proposed rule whose mandates require spending in any 1 year of $100 million in \n1995 dollars, updated annually for inflation.  In 2020, that threshold is approximately $156 \nmillion.  This IFC was is not preceded by a general notice of proposed rulemaking, and thus the \nrequirements of UMRA do not apply. \nExecutive Order 13132 establishes certain requirements that an agency must meet when it \npromulgates a rule that imposes substantial direct requirement costs on state and local \ngovernments, preempts state law, or otherwise has federalism implications.

In addition, these two states would need to develop a CMP \nstructure to impose CMPs that is equivalent to CMS and is based on their updated standards. In \norder to determine compliance with the reporting requirements, the State Agencies would be \nrequired to perform additional surveys on 5 percent of CoW and 5 percent of PPM laboratories. \nAs previously stated, these two type of laboratories are not routinely surveyed.  The total number \nof CoW laboratories as of March 2020 is 193,474.  Five percent of 193,474 is 9,674 so for the \nduration of the IFC (3 years), a total of 3,225 CoW surveys would need to be performed annually \nacross all State Agencies.  The total number of PPM laboratories as of March 2020 is 30,120.  \nFive percent of 30,120 is 1,506 so for the 3 years that this IFC would be in place, a total of 502 \nPPM surveys would need to be performed annually across all State Agencies.  The combined \nnumber of these surveys that will need to be performed annually over the 3 years of the \ntimeframe of the IFC is 3,727 across all State Agencies.  Over the 3 years that this IFC is in \nplace, one-third of the total number CoW and PPM laboratories would be surveyed each year.  \nThis would ensure that a total of 5 percent of each of these types of laboratories are surveyed \nduring the duration of the PHE for COVID-19 to determine if SARS-CoV-2 requirements are \nmet. Currently, there are no resources available to the State Agencies to perform these additional \nsurveys.  Therefore, this IFC would have a substantial direct effect on state or local governments.  \nThis IFC would also have a direct effect on preempting state laboratory requirements as they \nmust change their current laboratory standards to remain equal to or more stringent than Federal \nlaws when finalized. \nC.

Following the May 8th effective date of this reporting requirement, we \nbegan assessing the compliance for all 15,674 (data from Quality, Certification and Oversight \nReports (QCOR) as of August 11, 2020) Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing homes each \nweek and have found compliance has consistently increased week after week.  Based on data \nprovided to CMS by the CDC, compliance with this requirement has been greater than \n98 percent since the reporting week ending June 28, 2020.  Although there has been \nunprecedented compliance with the requirement to report, CMS has issued 2,507 citations for \nnoncompliance as of August 10, 2020, with corresponding CMPs imposed.  Financial impact \nwill occur for facilities who are not compliant with the new reporting requirement.  We do not \nexpect these requirements to have a substantial economic impact or pose a financial burden to \nnursing homes beyond that which has already been established by CMS\u2019s existing enforcement \nregulations. This rule does not add new requirements, but clarifies our process to impose \npenalties for a failure to report for which compliance is assessed on a weekly basis, which is \ndifferent from how all other LTC requirements are reviewed.  CMS\u2019 enforcement authority \nremains unchanged under this IFC.  Instead, it clarifies the specific CMP penalty range for \nnoncompliance with the new COVID-19 related reporting requirements at \u00a7 483.80(g)(1) and \n(2).  Furthermore, the penalty amounts are consistent with the lower level penalty range available \nat \u00a7 488.438(a)(1)(ii) in order to encourage compliance and to discourage similar conduct in the \nfuture without causing undue hardship that could impair a facility\u2019s ability to minimize COVID-\n19 infections among its residents and staff.

CoP Requirements for Hospitals and CAHs, and Requirements for LTC Facilities \na.  CoP Requirements for Hospitals and CAHs to Report COVID-19 Data as Specified by the \nSecretary During the PHE for COVID-19  \nSection II.B. of this IFC revises the infection prevention and control requirements for \nhospitals and CAHs to more effectively respond to the specific challenges posed by the COVID-\n19 pandemic.  Specifically, we are adding provisions to require facilities to electronically report \ninformation related to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases in a standardized format \nspecified by the Secretary. Many hospitals are already reporting data in a standardized format \nvoluntarily. As detailed in section IV.G. of this IFC, we currently estimate the cost of these \nreporting requirements to total $212,232,900. This estimate is likely an overestimate of the costs \nassociated with reporting because it assumes that all hospitals will report manually.  Efforts are \nunderway to automate hospital and CAH reporting that have the potential to significantly \ndecrease reporting burden and improve reliability. We anticipate that the need for reporting will \nbe temporary in direct relationship to the duration of the PHE. Existing guidance on reporting, \nwhich may be revised in the future, can be found at \nhttps://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-faqs-hospitals-hospital-laboratory-acute-care-\nfacility-data-reporting.pdf, and these guidance documents will be in CMS\u2019 13891 portal.

Based on data from CDC and states where similar policies have already \nbeen implemented, we anticipate that this will result in widespread testing and significant \nresource use, but catch many cases that might otherwise go undetected.  For example, \nimplementing universal testing in 11 LTC facilities in Maryland increased the total number of \ndetected cases in those facilities from 153 to 507.91  Costs incurred by facilities have potential to \nvary drastically depending on the extent of outbreaks in their respective communities, whether \nthe facility has point-of-care testing, and the size of each facility; however, for some of these \nfacilities the cost of testing may be less than the costs associated with lost productivity and \nrevenue due to unmitigated outbreaks.  We solicit comments on our cost estimates, as well as any \nadditional costs associated with acquiring reagents, test kits, or anything else we may not have \nconsidered. \nBest practices for catching and eliminating these outbreaks, as well as availability of the \ntools necessary to do so, is a quickly changing landscape. As of late July, over 600 point-of-care \nantigen testing devices had already been shipped to LTC facilities nationwide, with plans to \nprovide every facility with their own instrument(s) and tests within 14 weeks.92 This method of \ntesting effectively reduces the cost-per-test from approximately $100 to only $20. These efforts \nto provide every facility with these devices continue, but for the purposes of our estimates below, \nwe assume a cost of $60 per test; this accounts for the potential cost of replacing the antigen \n \n91 Bigelow BF, Tang O, Barshick B, et al.

The cost of these testing activities will ultimately depend on the extent of future \noutbreaks, and how the best practices, and thus our parameters for universal testing, evolve.   \n We recognize that testing alone is not enough to control, treat, and eliminate outbreaks of \nCOVID-19. Providing safe care is the inherent duty of all long term care facilities. Implementing \nhighly effective infection prevention and control procedures, such as proper hand washing \ntechniques and techniques for donning and removing PPE, are expected to be part of everyday \nfacility procedures and do not impose an additional burden upon facilities. CDC provides, and \ncontinually updates, their infection control guidance for LTC facilities.93 This guidance \nrecommends, among other things, expanded viral testing of all residents if there is an outbreak in \na facility; cohorting residents in a COVID-19 care unit; assigning dedicated staff to the \naforementioned care unit; and additional cleaning procedures. Although we do not have data to \nsupport exactly how many facilities are fully prepared for intervention at this scale, we assume \nthat most facilities have made basic preparations in line with current best practices. \nAcknowledging this uncertainty, we are assuming the average facility requires intervention \ncosting between 5 and 40 hours of the hourly wage of a registered nurse for each additional \nround of testing, doubled to account for the cost of overhead and fringe benefits. For facilities \nthat are less prepared, a different mix of staffing could provide additional support for a similar \ncost. \nIn Tables 7 and 8, we provide sensitivity analyses showing the potential costs of \nuniversal testing in LTC facilities given these unknown variables described above.

We note, as detailed in the HHS Guidelines, that there is substantial uncertainty \nregarding how VSL varies with age,98 making estimates of the VSL, which are typically \ndeveloped using wage data for working-age populations, potentially overstated in contexts such \nas this for a novel coronavirus that disproportionately affects the elderly; overstatement of the \nVSL would in turn lead to underestimation of the fatal illnesses that would need to be avoided in \norder for the regulatory provision to break even. \nConsistent with the HHS Guidelines, we assume that the average individual in these \nunderlying VSL studies is approximately 40 years of age, allowing us to calculate a VSLY of \napproximately $469,000 to $818,000 at 3 and 7 percent discount rates respectively.

We are requiring the AOs/ESs to report this \ninformation no later than 10 days after determining a laboratory is not reporting results, as \nrequired under \u00a7\u00a7 493.41 and 493.1100(a).  We assume a one-time cost would range from \n$9,967 to $14,950.  In addition, the AOs and ESs would be required to report to CMS every 10 \ndays those laboratories that have not reported test results as required.  The annual total number of \ntimes each AO and ES is required to report to CMS is 36.5 (365 days/10 days).  We estimate a \ncost of $1,192 to 2,383 per 10 days which translates to an annual total cost range of $43,508 to \n$86,980 to identify the laboratories and submit the information to CMS.  (See section IV.F. of \nthis IFC.) \ng.  Enforcement, Imposition of Civil Money Penalties (CMPs) \nCLIA/AO/ES surveyors typically perform approximately 16,577 surveys annually.101  In \naddition, the new requirements would also require 3,727 COW and PPM laboratories to be \nsurveyed annually for reporting requirements.  This is a total of 20,304 laboratories that would \nbe required to be surveyed annually and that may be impacted by the imposition of CMPs for \nfailing to report SARS-CoV-2 as required.  We estimate the fiscal impact of imposing CMPs on \nthe estimated 20,304 laboratories performing this testing to be 20 percent of laboratories \nperforming SARS-CoV-2 testing.

While we \nbelieve initially the number of laboratories having a CMP imposed would be significantly higher, \nwe postulate that the number of laboratories that will require the imposition of a CMP for not \nreporting SARS-CoV-2 test results will decrease during the PHE for COVID-19.  We believe \nthis decrease will be a result of laboratories implementing the new requirements included in this \nIFC.   \nWe have no data indicating how imposition of the alternative sanction of CMP would \naffect all laboratories.  Prior to the changes included in this IFC, CMPs were not imposed on \nCoW laboratories.  In 2016, CMS imposed 30 CMPs for an average of $35,436 per laboratory; in \n2017, 25 CMPs were imposed for an average of $72,237 per laboratory; and in 2018, 24 CMPs \nwere imposed for an average of $44,230 per laboratory. The average total CMP imposed per \nfined laboratory over the 3-year period was $52,634.  Based on our CMP requirements specific \nto SARS-CoV-2 at 493.1834(d)(2)(iii), we anticipate that would be a range of $1,000 per \nviolation and $500 for each additional day of noncompliance that test results are not reported.  \nFor example, we are providing estimates for a minimum period of 3 days and a maximum period \nof 30 days.  We estimate that the total cost of CMPs imposed across all laboratories collectively \nwould range from $8,122,000 to $62,945,500 (4,061 laboratories x $2000 (3 days) or 4,061 \nlaboratories x $15,500 (30 days)) for laboratories performing SARS-CoV-2 testing. (see Table \n10). \nh.  Infrastructure \nSeveral issues related to infrastructure have been identified (that is, reporting test results, \npersonnel) that will have an increased burden on all laboratories.  As stated above, for purposes \nof this IFC, we expect that the approximately 30 percent (n=77,024) of the total CLIA-certified\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 E 174  Includes information not released to the public unless authorized by law .

Furthermore, based on data \nfrom the CLIA website102 we are estimating that 75 percent of the 77,024 laboratories have a \nCoW (n=57,768), and 25 percent have a Certificate of PPM, CoC, CoA, or CoR (n=19,256).  \nGenerally, the types of facilities that have a CoW include, but are not limited to:  physician \noffice laboratories (45%); pharmacies (5%); skilled nursing/nursing facility (6%); and other \ntypes of point-of-care facilities.103  The facilities with PPM generally are physician office \nlaboratories (POL) or other types of point-of-care (POC) facilities.104  We would also estimate \nthat 45 percent of the CoC, CoA, and CoR laboratories would be POLs.  For these POL and POC \nlaboratories (n=66,433; 57,768 (CoWs) + 8,665 (other certificate types)), we believe there would \nbe infrastructure issues related to implementing the new CLIA requirement that test results must \nbe reported as required by the Secretary.  While reporting of SARS-CoV-2 test results affects all \nlaboratories performing this testing, we believe that meeting the new reporting requirements will \nbe more challenging for POL and POC laboratories given that this requirement creates the need \nfor systemic changes to the ability to report results.  If a laboratory does not currently have this \ncapability to report in the form and manner specified by the Secretary, they would need to \nexpeditiously ensure that the laboratory was able to submit the SARS-CoV-2 test results in such \nform and manner, and at such timing and frequency, as the Secretary may prescribe.  Personnel \nwould need to be trained to implement the new CLIA reporting requirements related to reporting \nof test results as prescribed by the Secretary.  Further, given that CoW laboratories are not \nrequired to meet any personnel requirements, including laboratory director and testing personnel, \nthis could contribute a significant challenge for these laboratories.

Update to the HRRP ECE Granted in Response to the PHE for COVID-19 \n In section II.D.3. of this IFC, we excepted the use of claims data from the first and \nsecond quarters of CY 2020 from the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program because of our \nconcern that the data collected during this period may be greatly impacted by the response to \nCOVID-19, and therefore, may not be reflective of a hospital\u2019s performance during this time.  \nThe existing individual ECE request form policy is accounted for in the currently approved \nHospital Inpatient Reporting PRA package, OMB control #0938-1022(expiration date December \n31, 2022). There are no changes to the individual ECE request form policy.  \nThis update does not require hospitals to complete any forms or submit any additional \ninformation, and therefore, the program does not anticipate any change in burden associated with \nthis IFC.  \nd. Update to the Hospital VBP Program ECE Granted in Response to the PHE for COVID-19 \nSection II.D.4. of this IFC updates the Hospital VBP Program ECE policy to allow CMS \nto exclude any data submitted regarding care provided during the first and second quarter of CY \n2020 from our calculation of performance.

Revised Performance Period for the FY 2022 SNF VBP Program as a Result of the ECE \nGranted for the PHE for COVID-19  \nIn section II.D.5. of this IFC, we are revising the performance period for the FY 2022 \nSNF VBP Program Year.  \nIn the FY 2021 SNF PPS final rule107, we set out estimated impacts of the FY 2021 SNF \nVBP Program. At this time, those estimates represent our best approximation of the financial \nimpact of the FY 2022 SNF VBP Program.  We anticipate that the revised performance period \nwould not have a substantial impact on the estimated payback percentage, Medicare savings, and \namount of value-based incentive payments redistributed to SNFs for the FY 2022 SNF VBP \nProgram. \n5.  NCD Procedural Volumes for Facilities and Practitioners to Maintain Medicare Coverage \nAs discussed in section II.E. of this IFC, these provisions result in no impact to the \nMedicare program because they will enable facilities and practitioners to continue to be eligible \nfor coverage under the impacted NCDs during the PHE for COVID-19 that would have been \neligible for coverage if the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred.  Without the pandemic, \n \n107 The FY 2021 SNF PPS Final Rule can be accessed at \nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/05/2020-16900/medicare-program-prospective-payment-\nsystem-and-consolidated-billing-for-skilled-nursing-facilities.\n\n  #       ### Response:\n            The existing individual ECE request form policy is accounted for in the currently approved Hospital Inpatient Reporting PRA package, OMB control #0938-1022 (expiration date December 31, 2022) The program does not anticipate  any change in burden associated with this IFC .\n  #       ", "### Instruction:\n  #       Summarize the following article:\n\n  #       CMS-3401-IFC AB/GB 08/24/20 E 183 \nINFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: \nThis information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential.

Limits on COVID-19 and Related Testing without an Order \nAs discussed in section II.F. of this IFC, we are revising the previous policy outlined in \nthe May 8th COVID-19 IFC, which allowed for broad COVID-19 testing for a single beneficiary \nwithout a physician or other practitioner order by establishing that only a single COVID-19 \ndiagnostic test and one of each other related test (as listed in the May 8th COVID-19 IFC) \nwithout a treating physician or other practitioner order is reasonable and necessary for Medicare \npayment. This limitation on tests without a treating physician/practitioner order will apply \nbeginning on the effective date of this rule, and any tests furnished prior to the effective date \nwould not be considered for purposes of the limit on tests without a physician or eligible \nordering practitioner order. We are also establishing a policy whereby the orders of pharmacists \nand other practitioners that are allowed to order laboratory tests in accordance with state scope of \npractice and other pertinent laws can fulfill the requirements related to orders for covered \nCOVID-19 tests for Medicare patients.  We do not anticipate that these changes will affect \noverall Medicare expenditures over time because they will better align the requirements for \nCOVID-19 and related testing with other Medicare laboratory tests, which require the order of a \nphysician or other practitioner based on the clinical needs of the beneficiary. \n6.
