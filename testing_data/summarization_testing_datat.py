test_set_summarization = [ {'article' : """Issuers generally are not permitted under federal law and regulations to reduce premiums that are otherwise due. However, in light of the urgent need to help individuals and small employers experiencing economic hardship maintain continuous coverage through the COVID-19 public health emergency, CMS will adopt a policy of relaxed enforcement with respect to 45 CFR 147.102, 155.200(f)(4), 155.400(e) and (g), 155.706(b)(6)(1)(A), 156.80(d), 156.210(a), and 156.286(a)(2)â€“(4) to allow issuers, on a temporary basis, to offer premium credits for 2020 coverage in the manner outlined in this bulletin. CMS encourages states to adopt a similar approach and, under this temporary exercise of enforcement discretion, will also not consider a state to have failed to substantially enforce applicable federal requirements under the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) or the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) if the state permits issuers to provide premium credits in the manner outlined in this bulletin. Similarly, in states where CMS is the primary enforcer of the applicable federal requirements, CMS will adopt a policy of relaxed enforcement to temporarily allow issuers to offer premium credits in the manner outlined in this bulletin.
Issuers wishing to provide premium credits for 2020 coverage must, in advance of providing these credits, receive the applicable regulatorâ€™s permission to provide premium credits as outlined in this bulletin, or CMSâ€™s permission in states where CMS is the primary enforcer of the applicable federal requirements.2 In addition to approval from the applicable insurance regulator, an issuer seeking to provide premium credits must also receive permission from any applicable Exchange through which they offer qualified health plan (QHP) coverage, as outlined in the information reporting requirements described below.
In their requests to provide these credits, issuers must indicate the fixed percentage by which they intend to provide credits against 2020 premium amounts and the month(s) in 2020 to which the credits would apply. This fixed percentage credit must be offered uniformly in a non-discriminatory manner3 to all members in a market in a state without regard to whether the plan is offered through or outside an Exchange, or whether the member is eligible for advance payments of the premium tax credit (APTC).

'summary' : """Normally, federal law prohibits issuers from reducing health insurance premiums. However, due to COVID-19 hardships, CMS is temporarily relaxing enforcement of certain regulations to allow issuers to offer premium credits for 2020 coverage. States are encouraged to adopt the same approach, and CMS will not penalize them for doing so.
Issuers who wish to provide premium credits must:
Obtain approval from their state regulator (or CMS in states where CMS enforces federal rules).
Get permission from any Exchanges where their Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) are offered.
Specify in advance the fixed percentage credit and applicable months.
Apply the credit uniformly and non-discriminatorily across all members in a state market, regardless of Exchange participation or tax credit eligibility.
ðŸ‘‰ Essentially, this is a temporary COVID-19 policy allowing insurers to give premium discountsâ€”something normally restrictedâ€”if they follow CMS and state approval processes.
