services such as enrollment, claims processing, and managing provider networks. Alternatively,
these employers can self-administer the services. Self-insured plans are regulated by the federal
government and are generally not subject to state insurance laws.

plan begins to pay. For example, if a consumer’s deductible is $1,000, their plan won’t pay anything
until the consumer has paid $1,000 for covered health care services. A plan with an overall deductible
may also have separate deductibles that apply to specific services or groups of services. For example, a
plan may have separate in-network and out-of-network deductibles.

with the Great Depression in the 1930s. In this chapter, we review the
history of health insurance and demonstrate how that history is linked
to current health insurance developments. Predating private health insurance
were efforts at government-sponsored coverage for workplace injury and a
tradition of industrial sickness funds. The Great Depression led hospitals and
then physicians to implement forms of insurance as means to ensure payment
for services. Interestingly, conventional insurance and managed care were
developed at this same time. The advent of World War II, the growth of the
labor movement, and the federal tax code all fostered the growth of employersponsored
coverage. Medicare was introduced in 1965 to provide coverage
to older citizens; it mimicked the private coverage common at the time.
Commercial insurers aggressively competed with others by offering lower
premiums to larger employers, based on their lower claims experience. Federal
preemption of state insurance laws led to dramatic growth in self-insured
employer plans. The 1980s saw the development of managed care, prompted
by rapidly increasing healthcare costs and the emergence of self-insured
employer plans. Managed care’s ability to selectively contract revolutionized
healthcare markets by introducing price competition and led to a backlash
against managed care. In the 2000s, healthcare costs are again rising rapidly,
and efforts are under way to encourage insured individuals to pay more outof-
pocket through the use of high-deductible health plans with tax-sheltered
health savings accounts. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care

of the employer. Third, they could argue that the worker was at least partially
at fault. Injuries were common, and court cases seeking to determine negligence
and obtain awards for damages were common. Fishback and Kantor
(2000) argue that state workers’ compensation laws arose because workers’
rights advocates saw such reforms as a means of shifting the costs of workplace
injury to the employer. Employers saw the reforms as a way to reduce
the legal costs associated with negligence claims and to increase the payments
to injured workers while reducing overall costs.
Between 1910 and 1915, 32 states enacted workers’ compensation
insurance. Under these programs, employers accepted full liability for
workplace injuries and could buy insurance coverage through their state.

three legal defenses against negligence. However, if they did not buy coverage,
they were denied these defenses.

income. Compulsory contributions from the employee, the employer, and
the state government would be included. Those who were not in a covered
group could join voluntarily. Between 1916 and 1919, 16 states considered such legislation; none
adopted it. Employers tended to oppose this legislation because, unlike
workers’ compensation, it did not have any offsetting reduction in costs.
Labor unions had mixed views. Samuel Gompers, the founder of the American
Federation of Labor (AFL), was opposed. He believed that workers
knew how to spend their money and the role of the union was to get them
more money to spend. The American Medical Association (AMA) officially

Cross, these plans began in 1929 in response to the Great Depression. Kessel
(1959) provides a vivid discussion of the early history. The Ross-Loos
Clinic in Los Angeles was among the first prepaid group practices, although
some earlier plans existed in Minnesota and Washington, and as early as
1905 and 1909, respectively (MacIntyre 1962). The clinic provided prepaid
care to the 2,000 workers and their families of the Los Angeles Department
of Water and Power. The department contracted with the clinic to provide
employees with comprehensive care. In response to this action, the founders
of the Ross-Loos Clinic were expelled from the county medical society. This
penalty was serious because hospital bylaws required medical staff members
to be members in good standing of the local medical society. Lack of medical
society membership meant that hospital access was denied.
Such physician opposition to prepaid group practice was common.
Dr. Michael Shadid and the Elk Grove, Oklahoma, Farmers Union created a
prepaid health plan enrolling 6,000 residents of Elk Grove for $50 per year.
The state medical society opposed the plan, attempted to deprive Shadid of
his license to practice, expelled him from the medical society, and kept other
physicians who were willing to practice with him out of Oklahoma through
licensure denials.
In 1933, Dr. Sidney Garfield established the Kaiser Foundation Health
Plan in California. He was charged with unprofessional conduct, and the state
board of medical examiners suspended his license to practice. This ruling was
overturned by the courts. Similar actions were directed against group practice
plans in Milwaukee, Chicago, and Seattle. Plan physicians were denied membership
in their local medical societies and denied access to hospitals.
As a result of being denied access to hospitals, the early prepaid plans
were forced to build and use their own hospitals. """,
